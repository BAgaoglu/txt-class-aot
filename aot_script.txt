Armin
(Narration) On that day, humanity remembered… the fear of oppression under them.

(Narration) And we were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.
[Scene: On the battlefield of Titans.]
Shadis
Everyone, get ready to fight! There’s only one target!

We will exterminate it and make this mankind’s first outside base!
Erwin
Target approaching!
Shadis
Split into fives! Remember your training! We’ll distract the target!

All attack teams, prepare to move up! We’ll close in on it from the sides!
Moses
Have a taste of mankind’s strength!








[Scene: In a field, far from the battlefield. Eren is waking up.]
Eren
Huh… Mikasa?
Mikasa
We should return home.
Eren
Why… are you here?
Mikasa
Were you in a deep sleep and thought you were still dreaming?
Eren
No, I think I was having a really long dream. What was I dreaming about…? I can’t remember.
Mikasa
Eren, why are you crying?


[Scene: In the streets of Shiganshina.]
Wallist
Hear! The walls were created with God’s wisdom!

The walls are the work of God! Not one soul shall dare desecrate the walls!


[Scene: Going back home from the field.]
Eren
Don’t tell anyone I was crying.
Mikasa
I won’t. But if you don’t know why you were crying, maybe you should talk to your dad about it.
Eren
Don’t be stupid, I can’t tell my dad about that!
Hannes
What were you crying about, Eren?
Eren
Hannes!
Hannes
Is Mikasa mad at you?
Eren
What?! Why would I be crying?

Ugh! You stink of alcohol!
Garrison 1
There’s nothing wrong with that!
Eren
You’re drinking again?
Hannes
You wanna join us?
Eren
No… Um… What about your work?
Hannes
Yeah, we’re watching the gates today.

We’ve been here all day, and we started getting hungry and thirsty.

But it’s not a big deal if we happen to drink something with a little alcohol in it.
Eren
But if you’re drunk… how are you going to fight?
Hannes
Huh, when would we have to fight?
Eren
Do you really need to ask?! When the Titans break the wall and come in!
Hannes
Ouch…

Hey Eren, don’t say those things loudly.
Garrison 1
If it isn’t Dr. Yaeger’s son… You’ve got spirit kid.

If they do end up breaking the wall, we’ll do our jobs.

But you know what? The Titans haven’t broken the wall once in the past one hundred years.
Eren
But my dad said that it’s times like these when we’re in the most danger!
Hannes
Dr. Yaeger said that? Well he’s right.

He saved our town from a plague once. We can’t thank him enough.

But these Titans are a different story.

I see Titans walking around all the time when I mend the walls. But speaking as a soldier, I don’t think they can do anything about the 50-meter wall.
Eren
S-so… you don’t even have the will to fight them?
Hannes
Nope.
Eren
Why not?! Why don’t you stop calling yourselves the Garrison and start calling yourselves the Wall Menders?!
Hannes
That doesn’t sound bad!

But Eren, when people see soldiers fighting, they know something bad happened.

Everyone’s much happier when we’re doing nothing and getting called useless freeloaders.
Eren
We might not get out, but we’ll live as long as we can and sleep.

But… we’re living like… like livestock.
Garrison 2
This kid sure knows how to talk!
Garrison 3
Not like he can do anything, right, Hannes?
Hannes
R-Right… Hey, Eren!
Garrison 1
You’re a strange kid!
Hannes
Does he… want to join the Recon Corps?


[Scene: Eren and Mikasa are going back home.]
Mikasa
Eren, it’d be better if you didn’t join the Recon Corps.
Eren
What, you think they’re stupid too?
Mikasa
I’m not saying anything like that.
[Action: Eren and Mikasa see the front gates opening.]
Eren
The Recon Corps is back! The front gate is opening! Let’s go, Mikasa! Let’s go see the heroes!
[Scene: Near the gates. Eren and Mikasa are in the crowd.]
Eren
Dammit, we can’t see!
Man 1
Why are there so few of them?
Man 2
All of them were eaten. That’s what you get for going outside the walls…
Moses’s Mother
Moses! Moses! My son, Moses, I can’t find him…

Where is my son Moses?
Shadis
This is Moses’s mother… Bring it here.
[Action: A soldier brings out a severed arm.]
Shadis
That was the only part of him we could bring back.
Moses’s Mother
But… my son… fulfilled his purpose, right?

He might not have been a hero, but he at least died helping mankind fight back, right?!
Shadis
Of course!

No… During this mission, we… No, even after all our missions…

We still haven’t made any progress! I’ve been a failure, and I’ve only gotten soldiers killed left and right! And we haven’t learned anything useful about the Titans!


[Scene: After the soldiers have returned, the crowd is dispersing.]
Man 1
That was really heavy.
Man 2
Seriously. So all we’ve been doing is offering ourselves to them as food.
[Action: Eren throws a rock at one of the men.]
Man 2
Ouch, what was that for, stupid kid?!
Eren
Hey, what are you doing, Mikasa?!
Man 2
Hey, get back here!
[Action: Mikasa and Eren run away.]


[Scene: Eren and Mikasa are on an empty street near home.]
Eren
Mikasa, enough already!
[Action: Mikasa throws Eren to the ground.]
Eren
What was that for?! Look at all the wood!
Mikasa
Eren, have you changed your mind about joining the Recon Corps?
Eren
Help me pick this up.








[Scene: At home.]
Eren
We’re home.
Carla
Welcome back. Wow Eren, I’m surprised you gathered all this firewood!
Eren
Y-Yeah…
[Action: Carla pinches Eren’s cheek.]
Eren
What was that for?
Carla
Your ears were red. You were lying. Mikasa helped you, didn’t she?
[Action: Grisha prepares to leave.]
Eren
Huh? Dad, are you heading out? For work?
Grisha
Yeah, I need to go see someone in the inner walls. I’ll be back in two or three days.
Mikasa
Eren… wants to join the Recon Corps.
Eren
Mikasa, you traitor!
Carla
Eren, what are you thinking? Do you know how many people die outside the walls?!
Eren
I do!
Carla
You clearly don’t!
Grisha
Eren… Why do you want to go outside the walls?
Eren
I want to see and understand the world outside. I don’t want to die inside these walls without knowing what’s out there!

On top of that, if no one takes on their jobs… then everyone who has died will have lost their lives in vain!
Grisha
I see. Well, my ship’s here. I better get going.
Carla
Wait, Grisha! Help me convince Eren!
Grisha
Carla, nothing can suppress a human’s curiosity.

Eren, when I return, I’ll show you the basement that I’ve kept secret from you.
Eren
Really? Have a safe trip!
[Action: Grisha leaves the house.]
Carla
I won’t allow it. You won’t be joining something stupid like the Recon Corps.
Eren
Huh?! Stupid?! People who are content living like livestock are more stupid!
[Action: Eren runs out of the house.]
Carla
Eren…! Mikasa, he’s really reckless. When trouble comes, be sure to help each other out.
Mikasa
Yeah.


[Scene: Out in the streets. Armin is being bullied.]
Bully 1
What’s wrong, heretic? Why don’t you punch me back if you want to prove me wrong?
Armin
Why would I do that? I won’t stoop to your level!
Bully 1
What did you say?!
Armin
You’re beating me up because you know I’m right and you can’t prove me wrong. Doesn’t that mean you’ve admitted you’re wrong?!
Bully 1
Enough with your damn arguments!
[Action: Eren runs up to the bullies.]
Eren
Stop!
Bully 1
It’s Eren!
Bully 2
He’s an idiot, he’s back again!
Bully 1
Does he want to get beaten?!
Bully 3
We’ll teach you a lesson!
[Action: Mikasa runs into the fight.]
Bully 3
M-Mikasa is with him!
Bully 1
It’s no use! Run!
Eren
Hey, they ran after seeing me!
Armin
No, they ran after seeing Mikasa… Ouch…
Eren
Hey, are you alright, Armin?
Armin
I can stand up by myself.
Eren
Ah, sorry…


[Scene: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are hanging out together near the gates.]
Armin
So after telling them that mankind needs to go outside eventually, they beat me, calling me a heretic.
Eren
Dammit. We just want to go outside. Why does everyone hate us?
Armin
Well, it’s been peaceful living inside these walls for the past 100 years. 
Titans might be let inside when people leave the walls, so the King’s government banned people from showing interest in the outside world.
Eren
We’re risking our own lives. No one has the right to stop us!
Mikasa
You can’t do that. No way.
Eren
Oh yeah, Mikasa! How dare you tell my parents!
Mikasa
I don’t remember agreeing to help you.
Armin
S-so, how did it go?
Eren
Well they weren’t happy about it.
Armin
I figured. People are crazy for believing that these walls will protect us forever.

Even though the walls have been intact for the past 100 years, there’s nothing that can guarantee that they won’t be broken down today…
[Action: An explosion occurs near the walls.]
Armin
Wh-What was that?!
Eren
An explosion?
Man 1
Over there!
Man 2
Something fell?
Man 3
I’m not sure.
Eren
Hey, Armin! What was that? What are you looking at?!
Armin
You’re kidding… That wall is 50 meters high!
Eren
It’s them… Titans!
Armin
I-It… made a hole in the wall…
Man 4
One’s coming!
Man 5
The Titans are inside!
Armin
We need to get…! Eren!
[Action: Eren runs off.]
Eren
My house is over there… Mom is…!
Armin
Mikasa!
[Action: Mikasa runs off.]
Armin
It’s over… The Titans have invaded this town!


[Scene: Nearing Eren’s house.]
Eren
Our house is definitely safe… After turning this corner, our house will be there like always…! Mom! Mom!
Carla
Eren…
Eren
Mikasa, grab that side! We need to move this pillar! Mikasa, hurry!
Mikasa
I know!
Carla
The Titans are entering… Eren, take Mikasa and run Hurry!
Eren
I want to run! Hurry up and get out!
Carla
My legs have been crushed by the debris. I can’t run even if I get out. You understand, right?
Eren
I’ll carry you and run!
Carla
Why can’t you just listen to what I say for once?! Please just listen to me one last time!

Mikasa!
Mikasa
No… No!
Carla
At this rate, all three of us will…
[Action: Hannes comes to the house.]
Carla
Hannes! Take the kids and run!
Hannes
Don’t take me lightly, Carla. I’ll kill the Titan and save all three of you!
Carla
Wait, you can’t fight it!
Hannes
She’s right. I can definitely save both of them. But now is my opportunity to repay my debt!
[Action: Hannes sees the Titan and freezes. He decides to take Eren and Mikasa.]
Eren
Hey, Hannes! What are you doing?!
Carla
Thank you…
Eren
Mom is still trapped in there!
Carla
Eren, Mikasa, live on!

Don’t leave…!
Eren
Stop!
[Action: The Titan picks up Carla and eats her.]
Armin
(Narration) On that day, humanity remembered… the fear of oppression under them.

(Narration) And were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.




Armin
(Narration) Over a hundred years ago, humanity suddenly found itself faced with a new predator. They were far more powerful than humans.


(Narration) Humanity was immediately pushed to the brink of extinction.


(Narration) The survivors built three walls: Maria, Rose, Shiina.

(Narration) There, they enjoyed a century of peace. However...








[Scene: In Shiganshina, where Titans are invading.]
Wallist
For till then I was a soul in misery, alienate from God and covetous of all earthly things.

Now, as thou seest, here punished for my doting.

Such cleansing from the taint of avarice do spirits, converted, need.

This mount inflicts no dire penalty.
[Action: Titan grabs a woman.]
Woman
No! Let me go!
Wallist
O avarice! What canst thou more, who has subdued our blood so wholly to thyself, they feel no care of their own flesh?
[Action: Titan grabs Wallist.]
Wallist
O avarice! What canst thou more, who has...


[Scene: Hannes is running with Eren and Mikasa. Eren hits Hannes.]
Hannes
Eren, what are you doing?!
Eren
We were so close to saving my mom! Why did you do that?!

We almost saved my mom!
Hannes
Get a hold of yourself!
[Action: Hannes throws Eren to the ground.]
Mikasa
Eren!
Hannes
Eren… The reason you couldn’t save your mom… is that you lacked the strength...

The reason… The reason I didn’t fight the Titan… was that I lacked the courage!

I’m sorry...
[Action: Hannes, Eren, and Mikasa continue walking. Mikasa holds her forehead.]
Mikasa
Ah, it’s happening again...


[Scene: Near the inner walls.]
Soldier
Hurry, to the inner gate! Use all ships at the pier for Shiganshina’s evacuation!

Hurry! They’ll eat you!


Armin
(Narration) There are small areas that protrude, like Shiganshina, all around the wall. Their purpose is to attract the Titans, thus reducing the cost and manpower of defending the walls.

(Narration) After the people of Shiganshina had fulfilled their function by drawing the Titans to them, they were forced to evacuate by a single gate.
[Scene: Near the inner walls.]
Soldier
Don’t bring anything aboard! We’re taking as many people as we can!
[Scene: On the boat.]
Armin’s Grandpa
Armin, sit.
Armin
But, Eren and Mikasa aren’t here yet...

Ah, they’re here!

Eren...
[Action: Eren and Mikasa board the boat, looking petrified.]
Armin’s Grandpa
Don’t talk to them just now.

Poor kids… Going by their appearances, it must have been bad...


[Scene: Near Wall Maria.]
Soldier
Why are you just standing there?! Hurry!

Where are those cannon shells?! Hurry! They’re right in front of us!




[Scene: On the boats near the inner wall.]
Man 1
This just can’t be happening...
Woman 1
Oh God… oh God...
Man 2
Hey! What are you doing?!
Soldier
The ship’s full!  It’s leaving!
Man 3
No way…! Please, at least take my child!
Soldier
I’m sorry, but I can’t! Go!
Woman 3
Let him on!
Man 4
Let us on!
[Action: Woman 3 and Man 4 jump to the boats and fall. The boat leaves.]


[Scene: Near the gate of Wall Maria.]
Soldier 1
Idiot! Where are you aiming?!
Soldier 2
B-But this thing doesn’t have that kind of accuracy!
Soldier 1
Right now, I don’t give a crap! Just load the next shell!
Soldier 2
It’s hopeless!
Soldier 3
The gate… It’s closing!

We need to retreat! We’ll be left behind!
Soldier 1
Hey!
Hannes
Don’t close it! Wait a little more! Many people are still in the city!
Soldier 4
If they break through this gate, we’ll lose more than a single city to the Titans!

We’ll lose the entire territory within this wall!
Hannes
But that doesn’t mean we can let these people die!
Soldier 5
Close the gate!
Soldier 6
The Titans are coming!
Soldier 7
Get that gate shut!
[Action: The gates begin to close.]
Hannes
Don’t do it! Hey!
Soldier 1
What… is that thing?!

Fire!
[Action: Shells are fired at the Armored Titan but nothing happens.]
Soldier 8
It’s not working! It’s coming!

The Titan’s coming! It’s going to ram the wall! Close the gate!
[Action: Armored Titan breaks through the gate.]
Hannes
The gate...










Armin
(Narration) Several hours after Shiganshina’s fall on Wall Maria’s south side, the news had spread throughout the entire human territory.
[Scene: In a building within Wall Rose.]
Man 1
Is it true?  Have Titans entered Shiganshina?

I can’t believe it… Why would walls that have lasted a century fall now?
Man 2
Whether you believe it or not, there are people out there who escaped by ship. At least five hundred, I’m told.
Man 3
The question is if we’ve lost Shiganshina alone.
Man 4
But they would certainly never penetrate Wall Maria, would they?
Man 3
At the moment, we should contact the central government and await orders.

We cannot handle an emergency such as this on our own!
[Action: Messenger enters the room.]
Man 5
Excuse me! A messenger arrived...

They say Wall Maria has been breached!  The Titans are invading!


[Scene: On the boat going into Wall Rose.]
Hannes
It’s over...
Man 1
It’s over… Humanity will be devoured by Titans again…!
Eren
It’s over…? I can never go home… Why…?!

Why did I waste my final minutes with her having some stupid argument?!

Now she’s gone… She’s never coming back…! Why…?!
Hannes
(Flashback) You lacked the strength...
Eren
Because I… Because humans are weak...

Is crying all we can do?!

I’ll kill them...
[Action: Eren stands up.]
Mikasa
Eren…?
Armin
What’s wrong, Eren?

Eren?
Eren
I’ll kill them all!  I’ll wipe every one of them… off the face of the earth!
Armin
Eren...


Armin
(Narration) That year, the central government decided to fall back within Wall Rose.

(Narration) During that period of time, the Titans consumed ten thousand people.
[Scene: Grisha rides through a forest going toward Wall Rose.]
Grisha
(Thoughts) Eren… Carla… Mikasa…! Please be safe!


[Scene: In Eren’s dream.]
Grisha
Eren… Eren… Eren… Eren!
Eren
Dad! Stop it, Dad! What are you trying to do?!
Grisha
Just give me your arm!
Eren
No! After mom died, you lost it!

Let me go, Dad!
Grisha
This is for your sake!
Eren
What are you saying?!
Grisha
Don’t forget the key, okay?! You must get there...

Someday, you’ll understand… Until that day…!
[Scene: In a compound in Wall Maria. Eren is lying down.]
Mikasa
Eren, are you okay? You were tossing and turning.
Eren
I feel like I saw my dad.
Mikasa
That can’t be… It was only a dream.
Eren
Was it?
Mikasa
Let’s go. They said they’re going to distribute food...
[Action: Mikasa and Eren get up.]
Mikasa
This was once a food storehouse.

They’re keeping refugees who fled by ship here.
Man 1
Hey, don’t cut in line!
Man 2
Shut up! I haven’t eaten anything since last night!
Mikasa
It isn’t yet certain that we’ll survive.
Armin
Eren, Mikasa!
Eren
Armin...
Armin
Look, I got here in time. My grandpa got these for us.
[Action: Armin gives bread to Mikasa and Eren.]
Mikasa
Thank you...
[Action: Soldier 1 looks at Eren, Armin, and Mikasa in a disgusted manner.]
Eren
What’s his problem…?
Armin
It can’t be helped… I don’t think there’s enough food for everyone. They say that’s all we’ll get for today.

There are too many refugees and not enough food to begin with.

You know the farther out you live, the less they care, right?
Soldier 1
Why do we have to share our food with outsiders?

If the Titans are breaking through anyway, they should have eaten more, so there would be fewer mouths.
Armin
Eren!
Soldier 1
Now there’s just that much less food.
[Action: Eren kicks Soldier 1.]
Soldier 1
Ow! What are you doing, stupid kid?!
Eren
You have no idea…! You’ve never even seen it!

You’ve never seen how they’ve eaten people…!
Soldier 2
Shut up!
[Action: Soldier 2 kicks Eren.]
Armin
I’m sorry! He’s just upset because he’s hungry!

That’s why he’s being so rude to an adult… I’m really sorry!
Soldier 1
Jeez… the only reason you aren’t starving is because of us! Even a kid should show gratitude!
Armin
Right!
[Action: The soldiers leave and Eren gets up.]
Eren
Damn it… No guy like that’s looking after me...

I’m going back to Wall Maria! I’m going to kill all the Titans!
Armin
Eren, you aren’t serious, are you?
Eren
I am serious! I’m not like them, sitting inside the walls and acting tough! I don’t need this!
[Action: Eren throws the bread to the ground.]
Armin
Eren, you’ll starve!
Eren
This doesn’t bother you?!

We can’t win until we can stop depending on stuff from them!
Armin
It’s impossible! We can't beat the Titans! There’s nothing we can do but live within the walls...

If you do something dumb, you’ll die, like my mom and dad!
Eren
So we should suck up to them instead?! Aren’t you ashamed?!
Armin
Right now… Right now, there’s no choice!
Eren
That’s just an excuse!

Then spend the rest of your life as cattle, weakling!
Armin
Mikasa?
Mikasa
If Armin is a weakling, so are we.

We didn’t even run from the Titans or the city on our own two feet.


We couldn’t even get the food we’re eating today without help.


Anyone so weak couldn’t possibly defeat a single Titan.

What matters is survival… like your mother said.
Armin
Mikasa!
[Action: Mikasa shoves bread into Eren’s mouth.]
Mikasa
Eat… and survive. I won’t let you starve!


Armin
(Narration) Several days later, refugees were sent in droves to till the wastelands to bring in more food. But even still, there wasn’t enough.


(Narration) And the following year, in 846, the central government used many refugees in an operation ostensibly to recover Wall Maria.

(Narration) Two hundred fifty thousand in all, approximately twenty percent of the population. But there were only just over a hundred survivors.


(Narration) Their sacrifice alleviated the food shortage for the rest of us somewhat.
[Scene: In the compound at night after Armin’s grandfather died.]
Eren
It’s all because of the Titans. If we destroy them, we can retake our home!

Armin… I’m enlisting next year.

I’ll gain the power to fight Titans!
Armin
Me, too…
Eren
Armin…!
Mikasa
I’ll go, as well.
Eren
Mikasa, you don’t have to… Didn’t you say that it’s important to survive?
Mikasa
That’s right… So I’ll go, to keep you from dying.
Eren
All right. The three of us.


[Scene: At the training field, during the day.]
Shadis
We now begin the enlistment ceremony for the 104th Trainee Corps!


I am Keith Shadis, and I had the misfortune to be assigned to train you bastards!


And I’m not here to welcome you at all!


Right now, you’re mere cattle, fit for nothing but Titan food! No, less than cattle!


In three years, we’ll take you worthless pieces of crap and train you! Give you the means to fight the Titans!


In three years, when you stand before a Titan, will you still be food?! Or will you be a noble wall, shielding the king?! Or perhaps, one of humanity’s glorious soldiers that slays Titans?!

You will decide!
Eren
(Thoughts) Yes… That’s what I’ll be. And I will kill every last Titan in existence!





[Scene: At the training field, during the day.]
Shadis
You there!
Armin
Yes, sir!
Shadis
Who are you?!
Armin
Armin Arlert, from Shiganshina!
Shadis
Yeah? That’s a stupid name. Your parents give you that?
Armin
My grandfather did!
Shadis
Arlert, what are you doing here?!
Armin
Trying to aid in humanity’s victory!
Shadis
That is indeed wonderful… Then you will feed the Titans!

Row 3, about face!

Who are you?!
Thomas
Thomas Wagner, from Trost.
Shadis
I can’t hear you!
Thomas
Thomas Wagner from --
Shadis
Too soft! Go practice in the cattle shed!

You, next!
Mina
Mina Karolina, from Karanes!
[Action: Two soldiers walk by while watching the Entrance Ceremony.]
Soldier 1
There he goes… When you were a trainee, your first day was just the same.
Soldier 2
It brings back memories.
Shadis
Wrong! You are from the pig shed, worth less than cattle!
Mina
Yes, sir! I am less than cattle!
Soldier 2
What’s the point of screaming at them?
Mina
Yes, sir!
Shadis
You, next!
Samuel
Yes, sir! Samuel Linke-Jackson, from Snate Village!
Soldier 1
It’s a right of passage. We force them to abandon who they are.
Shadis
A horrible name! Change it now!

What are you doing here?!
Soldier 1
Then, we raise them from nothing as pure soldiers. It is a necessary process.
Samuel
Sacrificing myself for humanity!
Shadis
Row 4, about face!
Soldier 2
It seems not all of them are being subjected to that process.
Shadis
Listen up! I’ve seen a lot of shit in my time, but you are the sorriest pieces of shit I’ve ever seen!
Soldier 1
There is no need for those who have already undergone the right of passage. If I were to guess, they probably lived through hell two years ago.

You can see it in their eyes. Well, let’s go.
Shadis
Who are you?!
Jean
Jean Kirschstein, from Trost!
Shadis
What are you doing here?!
Jean
Joining the Military Police for a life deep within the walls.
Shadis
Oh, I see… you want access to the Interior?
Jean
Yes!
[Action: Shadis headbutts Jean, and Jean falls to the ground.]
Shadis
Who said you could sit down?! Anyone who can’t handle this will never make it into the Military Police!

Who are you?! What are you doing here?!
Marco
Marco Bott, Jinae City, Wall Rose South District!

I want to join the Military Police to offer the King my body and self in service!
Shadis
Really… I’m glad to hear that. Good luck. However…

The King doesn’t want your body.

Next, you! Who are you?!
Connie
Connie Springer, of Ragako Villages, Wall Rose South District!
Shadis
You’re doing it wrong, Connie Springer…
[Action: Shadis grabs Connie and squeezes his head.]
Shadis
I explained that this salute demonstrates your resolve to devote your entire heart to the people… Is your heart on your right side?!
[Action: Sasha eats a potato.]
Shadis
Hey, you…  What are you doing?
[Action: Sasha doesn’t answer and continues eating the potato.]
Shadis
You’re the one I’m talking to! You! Who are you?!
Sasha
Sasha Blause, from Dauper Village, Wall Rose South District!
Shadis
Sasha Blause, what are you holding in your right hand?
Sasha
A boiled potato! The kitchen had a fresh batch, and I couldn’t resist.
Shadis
Did you steal it?

Why? Why would you choose to eat a potato now?
Sasha
Letting it get cold would’ve been a waste, so I decided I should eat it now.
Shadis
Well, I still don’t understand… Why would you eat that potato?
Sasha
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes?

Tsk...You can have half…
[Action: Sasha offers half the potato.]
Shadis
Half...


[Scene: At noon at the training compound.]
Connie
He’s still making that potato girl run.
Eren
Wow, five straight hours?

But she seemed more distraught when told she wouldn’t get dinner than when told she must run until she dropped..
Connie
If I remember correctly, Dauper Village is a tiny hunting village, deep in the mountains.
[Action: A wagon carrying people goes past.]
Eren
What’s that?
Mina
The dropouts. They requested a transfer to the frontier.
Armin
What? But it’s only the first day!
Eren
It was only a matter of time… If you aren’t strong enough, you have to leave.

Hard to believe they’d rather go back to weeding and picking up rocks.
Marko
Hey, he didn’t ask where you were from, did he?
Eren
Shiganshina, the same as him.
Marko
I see… That’s…
Connie
Then, weren’t you there that day?
Marko
Hey!
Connie
Did you see the Colossal Titan?
Eren
Yeah…


[Scene: At night in the cafeteria.]
Eren
I already told you I saw it.
Thomas
Really?
Samuel
How big was it?
Eren
Big enough to look over the walls.
Samuel
What?! I heard it stepped right over them!
Hannah
Me, too!
Franz
That’s what they said in my village!
Eren
No, it wasn’t that tall.
Mina
What did it look like?
Eren
It barely had any skin, but it had a huge mouth.
Boy
What about the Armored Titan that broke Wall Maria?
Eren
They call it that, but it looked like a normal Titan to me.
Samuel
Th-then what’s a normal Titan like?
[Action: Eren looks like he’s going to throw up.]
Marko
Guys, let’s stop with the questions. I’m sure he’d prefer to forget some things.
Connie
Sorry for asking --
Eren
Don’t be!

The Titans aren’t all that tough...

If we can master the 3-D Maneuver Gear, they won’t stand a chance!

Finally, I’m able to train as a soldier… I was just so excited, I forgot myself for a second!

I’m joining the Survey Corps, so I can wipe the Titans off the face of this earth! I’ll kill them all --
Jean
Hey, are you nuts? Did you just say you want to join the Survey Corps?
Eren
Yeah, I did.

And you said you wanted to join the Military Police to take it easy, right?
Jean
I’m no liar...

I’m a straight talker, unlike someone who pretends to have balls of steel, even when he’s about to piss himself.
Eren
Are you talking about me?
[Action: Eren makes a move to punch Jean.]
Marko
D-don’t…
Jean
Hey, I didn’t...

Well, I’m sorry.

I didn’t want to say you’re doing the wrong thing. Peace?
[Action: Jean holds out his hand to Eren.]
Eren
Yeah.  I’m sorry, too.
[Action: Eren whacks Jean’s hand away and walks out. Mikasa moves to follow.]
Jean
Hey, you…
[Action: Mikasa turns to Jean.]
Jean
W-w-well, uh...

It’s just that you look different from the rest of us.

I’m s-sorry… Your hair is very pretty...
Mikasa
Thanks.
[Action: Mikasa leaves and catches up to Eren walking away.]
Eren
I’m fine, leave me alone.
Mikasa
You’re always so impulsive when you’re riled up.
Eren
This again?

Anyway, isn’t your hair a little long? It could cause an accident when you’re practicing with the Maneuver Gear.
Mikasa
Very well. I’ll cut it. But how short should it be?
[Action: Jean wipes his hand on Connie’s shirt as he watches Mikasa and Eren.]
Connie
H-hey! That’s my shirt! What did you wipe on my shirt?!
Jean
My trust.


[Scene: Outside the sleep quarters at night. Krista is carrying bread. Sasha has just finished running.]
Sasha
I’m finally finished...
[Action: Sasha sniffs the air and nabs the bread from Krista.]
Sasha
This is… bread!
Krista
That’s all I could get, but I saved it for you...

But you should drink some water first.
Sasha
Are you a god?!
Krista
Wait --
Sasha
God!
[Action: Sasha is running like a crazy person.]
Ymir
Hey, what are you two doing?
Krista
Um, she spent the whole day running…!
Ymir
So you’re trying to do a good deed?

Did you do that for the potato girl? Was the effort worth what you got out of it?

Well, it doesn’t matter… Anyway, I’m carrying her to bed.
[Action: Ymir picks up Sasha.]
Krista
Are you doing a good deed, too?
Ymir
I’m doing her a favor so she’ll owe me.

I’m looking forward to a lot of fun from this idiot.


[Scene: At the training compound the next day.]
Shadis
First, we’ll evaluate what you have!

Anyone unable to do this can’t even serve as a decoy! They will be sent to the frontier!
[Scene: Soldiers walking while watching the Training.]
Soldier 1
These involve only the rudimentary basics, but even at this stage, you can see their potential with the Maneuver Gear.
[Action: The soldiers watch Mikasa.]
Soldier 1
Look. She’s steady as a rock. She knows exactly what to do. That’s what I mean by potential.

Looks like we have a lot of talent this year.
Soldier 2
Um, what about him?
[Action: The soldiers look at Eren, who is upside down in the setup.]
Soldier 1
That’s exactly my point. You may have the will, but not necessarily the talent.
[Scene: At the training compound.]
Shadis
What are you doing, Eren Jaeger?! Pick yourself up!
Eren
(Thoughts) What is this…? How am I supposed to do this?! This can’t be happening…








[Scene: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are practicing together after training.]
Mikasa
Stick to the basics and you should be fine. Don’t worry about doing well.

Watch the balance and stay centered. Slowly rest your weight on the belts attached to your hips and feet.
Armin
Stay calm, and you can do it. I was able to.
Eren
Okay, I think I can do it this time!

Raise me, Armin!
Armin
Okay.
[Action: Armin raises Eren in the setup, but Eren falls flat on his face.]


[Scene: In the cafeteria at night.]
Franz
Hey, Daz. Isn’t that the kid from yesterday who said he’d kill all the Titans?
Daz
Well, I bet he’ll be off to the frontier tomorrow. We don’t have enough food to feed worthless rejects.
Mikasa
Eren?
Armin
There’s no point in worrying. You just have to figure it out tomorrow.
Eren
I’m pathetic… I’ll never be able to kill them all like this.
Mikasa
You should let that idea go.
Eren
What?!
Mikasa
You should give up on being a soldier. There are other ways to fight than by throwing away your life.
Eren
Listen here...

I saw what happened that day! You really think you’ll convince me this way?!
Mikasa
But it doesn’t matter how much you want it.
Eren
What?!  Why not?
Mikasa
It isn’t your decision whether you end up a soldier or not, Eren.

I’m not saying you should return to the frontier alone.
Eren
Let’s go, Armin.
Armin
S-sure.
[Action: Eren and Armin walk away from the table without Mikasa noticing.]
Mikasa
Don’t worry… I will go with you.
[Action: Mikasa notices that Eren and Armin are gone. Sasha is staring at her.]
Sasha
Um, anyway… So, can I take that?


[Scene: Inside Connie’s and Jean’s room at night.]
Connie
The trick to staying upright?

Sorry, but I’m a genius. All I can say is to feel it.
Jean
Actually, I’d like you to tell me...

How are you still sane, after you humiliated yourself like that?
Eren
Guys, I’m begging you here…!
Connie
But didn’t you say just yesterday something like, “People who aren’t strong enough should leave”? Am I wrong?

Or was it, “If you don’t have the talent, you have to leave”?  Which was it?


[Scene: At Reiner’s and Bertolt’s room at night.]
Eren
Please! I’ve heard you two are really good!

Bertolt… Reiner!
Reiner
Sorry, but I just can’t imagine any trick to just hanging there. I don’t think I can give you the advice you’re looking for.
Eren
Okay...
Armin
We’ll just have to hope for the best tomorrow.
Bertolt
You two are from Shiganshina, aren’t you?
Armin
Yes…  Why?
Bertolt
Then you should know how terrifying the Titans are. Why did you decide to be soldiers?
Armin
I’m not like Eren. I didn’t see them at close range.

But when I thought about how the government forced people into that insane plan to retake Titan territory, I had to do something.
Bertolt
I see.
Armin
Where are you two from?
Bertolt
Reiner and I come from a small village in the mountains of southeast Wall Maria.
Armin
But… that means...
Bertolt
Yeah. It isn’t like the big towns by the rivers… The news was slow to reach us. In fact, the Titans reached us first.

It was dawn. The animals were unusually restless, and we heard a rumbling we’d never heard before.

Eventually, as it got louder, we realized it was the sound of footsteps. And when I rushed to open the window...

Beyond that… I don’t really remember.

Everyone was in a panic.
Reiner
Hey… why are you discussing this now?
Bertolt
I’m sorry…  What I mean to say is this...

You aren’t like the others.
Armin
The others?
Bertolt
Those here who don’t understand how terrifying the Titans really are.
Reiner
Enough.
Bertolt
The vast majority are here because they don’t want to lose face.

Told they’d be admitting they were cowards if they chose to be workers, after turning twelve, they became trainees.

But we’re not really so different. We chose this hoping to join the Military Police because they’re safe, deep within the Interior.

If that doesn’t work, we may just give it all up. I don’t have any will of my own...
Armin
There’s nothing wrong with valuing your own life.
Reiner
I just want to return to the homeland I lost. That’s all I have left to go on.

I’m going back, no matter what.
Bertolt
You…  Why did you become a soldier?
Eren
I… I decided I had to kill them. I had to kill all the Titans myself...

That was what I decided.
Reiner
So even after seeing the Titans, you didn’t surrender to despair?
Eren
No… Though I don’t know if I can even become a soldier now.
Reiner
Review and recheck everything, starting with your belt. Tomorrow will go fine.

You can do it. Eren Jaeger, was it?
Eren
Yeah, thank you.Reiner Braun, right?


[Scene: At the training grounds the next day.]
Shadis
Eren Jaeger, are you ready?
Eren
Yes!

(Thoughts) I’ll do this…  I can do this! I may not have talent, but I have more guts than anyone.
Shadis
Begin!
[Action: Eren begins to be raised in the setup.]
Eren
(Thoughts) I don’t know the theory… I don’t have any evidence… But this is all I’ve got! This is… this is my weapon!
[Action: Eren successfully stays balanced in the setup.]
Eren
(Thoughts) I did it!
[Action: Eren begins to waver in the setup.]
Eren
(Thoughts) N-not yet… I’m not giving up yet!
[Action: Eren falls flat on his face.]
Shadis
Put him down.
[Action: Eren is put down on the ground.]
Eren
I… I…!
Shadis
Wagner, change belts with Jaeger.
Thomas
Y-yes, sir!
[Action: Thomas and Eren switch belts. Eren is raised in the setup again and is in balance.]
Shadis
Your equipment was defective. The fitting on your belt was damaged.

I’ve never heard of this part getting damaged. I’ll have to add it to the maintenance checklist.
Samuel
So, he managed to stay upright for a bit, even with a broken belt?
Franz
Wow…!
Eren
Th-then… did I pass?
Shadis
You’re fine. Commence training!
Eren
(Thoughts) I did it! I really did it! Did you see that, Mikasa?! I can do this! I can fight the Titans! I don’t need you taking care of me anymore!
Reiner
I guess it all worked out.
Armin
He’s looking at us, as if to say, “See!”
Mikasa
No… He’s relieved because he thinks we won’t have to be separated now.
[Action: Reiner and Armin look at Mikasa in disbelief.]
Shadis
Grisha… today, your son… became a soldier.


Armin
(Narration) Year 845.

(Narration) The Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan appeared out of nowhere. Instantly, the walls were shattered, along with the illusory peace of everyday life.

(Narration) Thus, driven by a century of hunger, the Titans descended upon mankind once again.
Eren
(Flashback) Stop!
Armin
(Narration) Mankind abandoned Wall Maria.

(Narration) They lost a fifth of their population, and a third of their territory, as human activity was pushed back to Wall Rose.








[Scene: In a forest for training, two years after enlisting.]
Shadis
You’re slow! Run, you shitheads!

What’s wrong, Arlert? You’re falling behind! Is it too hard for you? Do you want to be the only one who puts down his equipment?

If this was a real mission, you’d be Titan food already!
Armin
Dammit!
Reiner
Give it to me!
[Action: Reiner takes Armin’s pack.]
Reiner
You’ll end up dropping out this way! We’re being downgraded on today’s training!
Armin
But now, they’re gonna punish you, too!
Reiner
Then do your best so they won’t find out! Don’t make me change my mind!
Shadis
(Thoughts) Reiner Braun. He possesses great mental and physical fortitude. His comrades trust him deeply.
Armin
I’d rather die than live as a burden!
[Action: Armin runs up to Reiner and takes back his pack.]
Shadis
(Thoughts) Armin Arlert. While he lacks in physical strength, he makes up for with extraordinary academic aptitude.
[Scene: In the forest during the day, the recruits are cutting up dummy titans.]
Shadis
(Thoughts) Annie Leonhart. While her fighting skills are outstanding, she doesn’t work well as part of a team. A lone wolf.

(Thoughts) Bertolt Hoover. He is highly talented, but he lacks initiative.

(Thoughts) Jean Kirstein. His 3D control skills are top class, but his overtly blunt personality causes friction.
Jean
I can’t fight like them. I need to find my own Titan first!

(Thoughts) I will get accepted into the Military Police!
[Action: Jean finds a titan dummy to cut.]
Connie
Thanks, Jean!

I knew following you would work!
[Action: Sasha cuts the dummy before Jean or Connie.]
Sasha
I did it! Haha!
Shadis
(Thoughts) Sasha Blouse. She’s talented at operating unconventionally, but that mentality makes her unfit for organized activity.

(Thoughts) Connie Springer. He’s skilled at making sharp turns, but his mind is nowhere near sharp enough.
Soldier
Here they come!
[Action: More titan dummies are lifted. Eren and Mikasa arrive.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Shit! I still didn’t cut deep enough.
Shadis
(Thoughts) Mikasa Ackerman. Her performance is exemplary in every subject. She is truly a genius of historically-unprecedented significance.

(Thoughts) Eren Jaeger. While he lacks any outstanding talents, he improved his grades through outstanding diligence. In addition, he possesses an exceptional sense of purpose.


[Scene: At the training grounds, where trainees are sparring. Eren flips over Reiner.]
Reiner
Ouch!
Eren
Sorry, man. I suck at holding back.
Reiner
You play the bad guy next.
[Action: Reiner holds out a wooden dagger to Eren, but Eren hesitates to take it.]
Reiner
What’s wrong?
Eren
I just don’t see the point of training like this. It’s not like soldiers fight other humans.

Plus, only a fool would go bare-handed against an armed opponent.
Reiner
That’s irresponsible thinking. We’re soldiers. There are times we can’t back down, no matter how hopeless the situation.

We can’t always be sure who or what we’re up against, so we master artillery and hand-to-hand combat, too.

That’s our responsibility as soldiers.

Would ya look at that?
[Action: Eren and Reiner watch Annie walk by.]
Eren
Oh, it’s Annie. The officers never notice her sneaking off like that.
Reiner
Hey, Eren. Let’s teach that slacker a lesson.

We’ll show her how true soldiers ought to behave.
Eren
Huh?
[Action: Reiner moves to stand in front of Annie as she’s looking around.]
Reiner
You looking for a headbutt from the instructor?

If you don’t wanna get any shorter, I suggest you recall your first day here and get serious.
Eren
What are you talking about?

(Thoughts) She’s furious. I’ve always thought she wore a scary face, but that’s nothing compared to right now.
Reiner
Let’s get moving, Eren.
Eren
Me?
[Action: Annie gets into her fighting stance.]
Eren
Annie, you know what to do, right? Here I come!
[Action: Eren charges at Annie, but she kicks his leg. Eren falls over.]
Eren
What? She kicked me in the leg?
[Action: Eren tries to get up but falls back down in pain.]
Annie
Can I go now?
Reiner
No. It’s not over until he lets go of the dagger.
Eren
Wait, Annie! We’re supposed to do it the way --
[Action: Annie sweeps Eren’s legs, resulting in Eren falling with his behind in the air. Annie walks away. Annie tosses the dagger to Reiner.]
Annie
Here. Now it’s your turn to attack me.
Reiner
I don’t…
Eren
Do it, Reiner.

You’re gonna teach her the responsibility of being a soldier, right?
Reiner
Yeah. Sometimes a soldier can’t back down.

Like right now!
[Action: Reiner lands like Eren. Annie walks away.]
Eren
Your technique is incredible… Who taught you how to fight?
Annie
My dad.
Eren
Your father could --
Annie
Who cares? Doing this is pointless.
Eren
You mean this training?
Annie
Anti-personnel techniques don’t factor into our scores. So people just take it easy until it’s over.

The right to join the Military Police and live in the secure Inner District is only granted to the top scoring ten graduates.

The people who bother participating in this are either stupidly serious like you, or seriously stupid.
[Action: Shadis walks up to Sasha and Connie, who are goofing off.]
Eren
Crap, it’s the instructor!
[Action: Annie grabs the wooden dagger and points it at Eren’s throat. Eren struggles to keep her from pushing it further.]
Annie
Why in this world are the people most capable of opposing the Titans the only ones given the privilege of avoiding them entirely?

How do you think it got to be such a farce?
Eren
Who knows?
[Action: Annie sweeps Eren’s legs again as he’s attacking, putting the wooden dagger to his throat.]
Annie
Maybe it’s just human nature?

Point is, I can’t even pretend to be stupid enough to play soldier in this insane world.
[Action: Annie gets off Eren and walks away.]
Reiner
Then you’re not fit to be a soldier.
Eren
(Thoughts) I was so obsessed with getting stronger that I didn’t notice. It’s such an obvious contradiction.

(Thoughts) They’re just improving their Titan-killing skills so they have a chance to get further away from them.


[Scene: At the mess hall, at night.]
Armin
It’s just natural. Before the fall of Wall Maria, only the few soldiers of the Recon Corps actually utilized the 3D Maneuver Gear.

With limited usage or innovation, the entire practice would naturally fall into decline…
Jean
You should rev it up hard, but just for a second. Using inertia that way, you can minimize gas consumption.
Daz
You make it sound so simple.
Jean
Sure, it’s not something anyone could master. But it’s still worth remembering if you’re trying to get into the Military Police.
Marco
It’d be great if I could get in…

There’s no higher honor than working near the King.
Jean
C’mon, Marco! Stop being such a goody-goody and just tell the truth.

You want to join the Military Police so you can live a simple, comfortable life within the Inner District.
Marco
No, I actually want to --
Eren
So interior life’s simple and comfortable?
Jean
Huh?
Eren
Five years ago, this place was also part of the interior.
Jean
What’s your point, Eren?
Eren
Jean, you’re such a simpleton, you’d be comfortable wherever you go.
[Action: The other soldiers laugh quietly.]
Jean
Damn you…
Eren
Don’t you think it’s crazy? Learning how to kill Titans just to run away from them?
Jean
You bring that up now? This farce should be kept going for my sake if nothing else!
Eren
You damn bastard!
Jean
Fuck off and face reality!
Armin
Eren, stop it!
Mikasa
Stop this.
[Action: Mikasa slaps Jean’s hand away and takes Eren’s hand.]
Jean
Dammit, you asshole!
Eren
Fuck you! I backed off!
Jean
Who cares! I’m so jealous!
Eren
What the hell are you even talking about?!
[Action: Eren pauses to see Reiner and Annie eyeing him.]
Eren
(Thoughts) I see… He’s just blowing off steam, just like I did back then.

(Thoughts) But not this time. I’ll use my skills to resolve the situation.
[Action: Eren uses the same hand-to-hand skills that Annie used to topple Jean.]
Jean
That hurt…

What the hell was that?!
Eren
That was a move I learned while you were slacking off.

If you really think reality is just living comfortably and following your own whims, can you seriously dare to call yourself a soldier?
[Action: Shadis opens the door to the mess hall.]
Shadis
I thought I just heard some kind of loud noise. Someone care to enlighten me as to what’s going on?
[Action: Jean and Eren return to their seats. Mikasa raises her hand.]
Mikasa
Sasha just ripped a giant fart, sir.
Sasha
What?!
[Action: The soldiers laugh quietly.]
Shadis
You again?

Learn some self-control!


Armin
(Narration) Thus, the graduation of the 218 trainees drew near.
Soldier
Hands on your hearts!
Trainees
Yes, sir!
Soldier
For you trainees graduating today, three paths now open before you.

You can be stationed at the walls and defend the cities as members of the Garrison!

You can put your lives on the line to fight the Titans in their own territory as members of the Recon Corps!

And you can serve the King by controlling the crowds and protecting order as members of the Military Police Brigade!

Of course, only ten people with top scores as announced earlier are allowed into the Military Police!
Eren
(Thoughts) Finally, I made it this far.

(Thoughts) Now, it’ll be our turn to devour the Titans!








[Scene: At the mess hall, later that night. All the trainees are celebrating.]
Connie
I did it! I’m in the Military Police now!
Sasha
We’ll never have to worry about having food again!
Jean
Why am I below Eren? That bastard…
Thomas
You don’t wanna join the Military Police, Eren? Are you serious?
Samuel
But you’ve got one of the top ten scores!
Eren
I’ve been dead-set on my goal since the very beginning. I didn’t train to live comfortably within the Inner District.

I worked this hard so I could fight the Titans.
Thomas
But you can’t possibly win!
[Action: The trainees all go silent.]
Thomas
You know full well… You know just how many have been eaten by them.

We’ve lost more than twenty percent of the entire population already.

Mankind doesn’t stand a chance against them.
Eren
So?
Thomas
Huh?
Eren
You’re just giving up because you think you can’t win?
Thomas
Uh…
Eren
It’s true. We’ve suffered only defeats so far. That’s because we hardly knew anything about them!

We can’t defeat them using sheer numbers. We may have lost, but the knowledge we obtained from those battles is our guiding beacon of hope.

Yet you’d discard the tactical progress bought by hundreds of thousands of sacrifices, just to serve yourself up on a silver platter? You’ve gotta be kidding me.

I’ll kill every last one of them and break free of these walls! That is my dream! Mankind hasn’t lost everything yet!
[Action: Eren runs out of the mess hall. Armin and Mikasa run after him.]
Armin
Wait, Eren!
Jean
(Thoughts) Go outside those walls, if you’re so keen on it. I’m going to the Military Police.
[Scene: Outside the building. Eren is sitting on the stairs. Armin and Mikasa approach him.]
Armin
Eren, can we talk about your dream?
Eren
Yeah. After all, I got it from you. Breaking free of the walls and all that…
Armin
I’m going to enlist in the Recon Corps.
Eren
Are you for real, Armin?

You’re our top theoretician! Put that to better use!
Armin
I don’t care if I die as long as I can be useful.
Mikasa
I’m going to be in the Recon Corps, too.
Eren
You got the top score, didn’t you? Go to the Military Police!
Mikasa
I’ll go to the Military Police if you do.

If you go to the Garrisons, so will I.

You’ll die an early death if I’m not there for you.
Eren
I never asked for that.
Mikasa
I don’t want to lose what’s left of my family.


[Scene: At the gates the next day. The Recon Corps is leaving.]
Man 1
They’re here! The main force of the Recon Corps is here!
Man 2
Commander Erwin! Kick their Titan asses for me!
Man 3
Look! There’s Commander Levi!
Man 4
They say he alone counts for a full unit!
Levi
Tsk… Can they shut up?
Eren
They look completely different from five years ago. People really count on the Recon Corps a lot.
Hanna
It’s cheering everyone up. The past won’t have to be repeated.
Franz
The artillery has been improved as well. That Colossal Titan won’t come again, right?
Hanna
Yeah.
Eren
How can you be so naive, you old married couple?!
Hanna
Don’t call us a couple!
Franz
Don’t be so hasty, Eren.
Hannes
Hey, you there.
Eren
Hannes!
[Action: Hannes walks toward Eren, Mikasa, and Armin through the crowd.]
Hannes
You guys graduated yesterday, right? I can’t believe they really let you kids through.
Eren
I heard they made a drunkard like you Captain of a Garrison.
Hannes
Touche!

Sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t save your mother.
Eren
It’s not your fault, Hannes.

I’m no longer ignorant. I won’t let that sort of tragedy happen again.

I will defeat the Titans.
[Action: Eren runs off, leaving Mikasa and Armin behind. Hannes watches on.]
Hannes
(Thoughts) Should I be happy or not that he’s grown into a man?

(Thoughts) Just don’t die.


[Scene: On top of the walls, with the Garrison.]
Eren
What? You enlisted in the Recon Corps?

Connie! You were going on and on about joining the Military Police!
Connie
Yeah, I know. But…
Mina
Seems like he was listening to your lecture yesterday.
Eren
Huh?
Connie
Shut up! This is my own decision!
Thomas
Don’t be so shy about it. You’re not the only one.
Eren
Thomas… Are you serious…
Sasha
Um, guys…

I borrowed some meat from the officers’ morning rations.
Eren
Sasha… You wanna get solitary confinement?
Samuel
You’re a real idiot!
Connie
Real idiocy is scary…
Sasha
Let’s all split it up together later. We’ll slice it up and eat it with bread!
Connie
Bring it back!
Mina
Yeah. Meat is a luxury now that we’ve lost so much land!
Sasha
Don’t worry about it. Once we retake the land, we can keep cows and sheep again.
Samuel
I’ll take the meat!
Connie
Me, too, so save my part!
Mina
That goes for me, too.
Eren
Guys…
Samuel
What do you say, Eren?

They’ll find us out if we don’t get back to work.
Mina
It’s still a while before lunch.
Eren
(Thoughts) Five years have passed since then. Mankind’s finally regaining its dignity.

(Thoughts) We can win. Mankind’s counterattack starts now!
[Action: Thunder sounds, and the Colossal Titan appears at the wall. Rocks from the wall break from the gate.]
Eren
Ah!
[Action: Steam from the Colossal Titan blows all the cadets off the wall.]
Samuel, Mina
Ah!
Eren
What the?!
[Action: Eren and the other cadets grapple to the wall. Connie sees Samuel falling and tries to save him.]
Connie
Samuel!
Mina
Sasha!
[Action: Sasha unhooks from the wall and goes to save Samuel. She hooks his leg.]
Sasha
Samuel! Don’t move!
Eren
That was close.
Thomas
The gate’s… broken…
Connie
Again… The Titans will get in again!
[Action: Eren flashes back to the scene where his mom is eaten by the Titan.]
Eren
(Flashback) I’ll kill them all! Every single one of them!

Every… fucking… one…

Ready the artillery! Four groups! Prepare for battle!
[Action: Eren swings up toward the top of the wall.]
Eren
The target’s right in front of us! It’s the Colossal Titan!

This is our chance! Don’t let it slip away!
[Action: Eren lands on top of the wall, facing the Colossal Titan.]
Eren
Hey, there. It’s been five years.


Armin
(Narration) Year 845.

(Narration) The Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan appeared out of nowhere. Instantly, the walls were shattered, along with the illusory peace of everyday life.

(Narration) Mankind abandoned Wall Maria.

(Narration) They lost a fifth of their population, and a third of their territory, as human activity was pushed back to Wall Rose.

(Narration) Then in year 850…
[Scene: Midday. Eren stands on the wall overlooking the outside territory.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Mankind’s counterattack begins now!
[Action: The Colossal Titan appears behind the wall.]
Eren
The target’s right in front of us! It’s the Colossal Titan!

This is our chance! Don’t let it slip away!

Hello there. It’s been five years.








[Scene: Midday. Eren is running along the wall to get to the Colossal Titan. The Colossal Titan sweeps along the top of the wall.]
Eren
(Thoughts) It aimed for the batteries!

(Thoughts) So it wasn’t just a coincidence that he targeted the gate!

(Thoughts) He’s actually… intelligent!
[Action: The Colossal Titan aims to grab Eren. Eren latches onto its arm with the 3D Maneuver Gear and swings up.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Still, this is our chance! This is the only one that can destroy the gates!

(Thoughts) If I can just stop him!
[Action: Eren moves to cut the back of the Colossal Titan’s neck.]
Eren
There!

You’re mine!
[Action: The Colossal Titan releases a cloud of steam before Eren can cut its neck.]
Eren
It’s hot!

Go!
[Action: Eren moves forward to cut the Colossal Titan’s neck but finds that it’s disappeared.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Did I miss?

(Thoughts) No… The Colossal Titan vanished…
Thomas
Eren! Did you get it?
Eren
No! It’s the same as five years ago!

He disappeared, just as suddenly as he appeared!
[Action: Eren makes his way back up the wall.]
Eren
I’m sorry. I let him get away.
Thomas
What are you apologizing for? We couldn’t even move --
Connie
Hey! There’s no time for chatting!

The wall’s been breached. If we don’t fix it quickly, the Titans will get in again!
Soldier
What are you waiting for?!

The strategy for handling a Colossal Titan’s appearance is already in motion! Return to HQ immediately!

Anyone who had contact with it, report every detail!
Eren
Yes, sir!
Connie
I pray for your success!


[Scene: Within the walls, at the street level. A warning bell sounds. The townspeople are panicking to get within the next enclosed wall.]
Soldier 1
Bring only your most critical possessions!

Please remain calm and evacuate!
Soldier 2
If they break through, the hellishness of five years ago will be repeated!

We must stop the Titans here!
[Action: Garrison soldiers ready the cannons from atop the walls.]
Soldier 2
Aimed and ready!

Fire!
[Action: The soldiers fire the cannons at the incoming Titans.]
Soldier 3
Attack!
[Action: The soldiers charge forward.]


[Scene: At headquarters. Eren and the other new recruits are getting ready to head into battle.]
Soldier
You recruits have completed training and graduated into proper soldiers!

I expect you to actively participate in this operation, too!
Franz
Don’t worry, Hanna. I swear I’ll protect you.
Hanna
Franz…
Eren
Are you okay, Armin?!
Armin
I-I’m fine! I’ll pull it together.

But we're still in trouble! We’ve got an eight-meter hole in the wall and no way to fix it quickly!

We couldn’t even dig out that giant rock near the front gate!

If we can’t close the hole, this city will be abandoned!

Then it’s only a matter of time until they break through Wall Rose!

If they felt like it, they could annihilate mankind at any time!
Eren
Armin!

Calm down! This time it’s different. Mankind won’t lose to the Titans!
Armin
S-Sorry…

I’m fine…


[Scene: Within the innermost wall. Lord Balto and Pixis are playing chess.]
Balto
Hey, are you even taking this seriously?

See? I win again.

I’m kind enough to play with you once every month, yet you fail to improve whatsoever, Pixis.
Pixis
I’m still far below your level, Lord Balto.
Balto
You’re the commander in charge of the Southern District!

How do you expect to win against the Titans with your level of skill and brains?
Soldier
Commander Pixis! We just got word!
Balto
What’s the meaning of this outra --
Soldier
The Colossal Titan just attacked Trost!

The gate has been breached!
[Action: Pixis gets up from his seat with Lord Balto and takes a drink of wine.]
Pixis
This booze is really top-shelf.

As your fellow on the battlefield, I humbly accept it.
[Action: Pixis and his soldiers leave. Lord Balto runs after them.]
Balto
Hey! Wait, Pixis!

Pixis! I said wait!

You can’t just leave!

Gather your men and focus on defending my property! That’s your duty, isn’t it?!
[Action: Pixis stops and turns to Lord Balto.]
Pixis
Lord Balto, right now soldiers are putting their lives on the line in Trost.
Anka
Commander, I’ll ready your horse.
Pixis
Many of them have probably died already, even at this moment while we speak.
Balto
Who cares about their lives? Just let them die!

Not to mention, you can’t even win on the board! Going there yourself would change nothing!
Gustav
Please, do not worry, Your Grace.

On the battlefield against the Titans, the Commander has no need to hold back.
Pixis
Quiet now.

Lord Balto.

Your Grace, just enjoy your peaceful day in luxurious delight as always.
[Action: Pixis and Gustav walk away.]
Balto
Hey! Pixis! Come back, Pixis! Pixis!








[Scene: At headquarters.]
Kitz
Just like in training, split up into your individual squads! You will be under Garrison command!

Your duties are to assist in providing supplies, communications, and sweeping up the Titans!

The first line of defense will be the frontline unit of the Garrison!

The second line will be the cadet squads under our command!

The rearguard will be the Garrison’s elite units!

We’ve already received word that the vanguard has be annihilated!

The outer gate was destroyed, and Titans have encroached upon the city!

This means that the Armored Titan might show up at any moment to breach the inner gate!
Daz
That’s…
Thomas
No way…
Nack
If even Rose falls…
Kitz
Silence!

The frontline guards are already in combat!

There is but one goal in this defensive operation: Defend Wall Rose until every civilian has evacuated!

Also, in case you forgot, let me remind you that desertion is a capital offense!

Vow on your hearts to devote your lives!

Dismissed!
Cadets
Yes, sir!
[Action: The cadets disperse to prepare for battle.]
Jean
Why does it have to be today?

I’m supposed to go to the interior tomorrow!
[Action: Daz vomits on the ground.]
Krista
Are you okay?
Soldier
No… No… No… No…
[Action: Jean walks away from the scene but bumps into Eren.]
Jean
You’re in the way!
Eren
Hey, Jean! What’s with you?
Jean
Don’t give me that crap, you suicidal asshole!

You wanted to join the Recon Corps! You were prepared to feed yourself to the Titans already!

But I was going to the interior tomorrow, goddammit!
Eren
Calm down!
Jean
Just chill out and accept my death?!
Eren
No! Remember our three years of training!

We’ve been on the verge of death many times during those three years. Some actually died.

Some ran away, and some were sent away. But we survived! Didn’t we?!

We’re gonna survive today, too!

You’ll survive today, and you’re bloody well going to the interior tomorrow!
Jean
Dammit!

Let’s go, Daz! You can’t cower there forever!
Mikasa
Eren. If the battle gets too chaotic, come find me.
Eren
Huh? We’re in totally different squads!
Mikasa
In the midst of the fray, nothing goes according to plan. I’ll protect you.
Eren
What are you going on abo --
Dietrich
Trainee Ackermann! You were specially assigned to the rearguard. Come with me.
Mikasa
I’d only be in the way there, sir!
Dietrich
I didn’t ask for your opinion.

The evacuation is going slow. We need as many elite guards as possible protecting the civilians.
Mikasa
B-But…
[Action: Eren headbutts Mikasa.]
Eren
Get real, Mikasa!

It’s so unlike you to panic!

Mankind is on the brink of extinction! No one gives a damn about what you want!
Mikasa
I’m sorry. I lost my head.

Just one thing. Please.

Please… don’t die.
[Action: Eren walks away.]
Eren
(Thoughts) I won’t die. I couldn’t die even if I were killed here.

(Thoughts) I don’t know anything about this world yet.


[Scene: A flashback to Eren and the other trainees during a lecture on Titans.]
Instructor
Even the remnants of our historical literature offer no hints about the origins of the Titans.

We know next to nothing about them.

What little we know about their bodies, we learned from the Recon Corps’ most recent reports.

The Titans show no signs of human-like intellect, and, therefore, there are no known instances of successful communication with them.

Their body structure is fundamentally different from that of all other creatures. They have no sexual organs, and their method of reproduction is unknown. Most of them have a physique resembling human males.

Their bodies exhibit extremely high temperature. To our confusion and dismay, they show no interest in any creatures except humans.

They are seemingly driven exclusively by the desire to consume humans, yet from the fact that they survived in an environment devoid of humans for over a century, we can safely conjecture that they have no need to eat.

Thus, their likely purpose is not predation, but annihilation.

The main factor behind the human race being driven into such a corner is the Titans’ astounding ability to survive.

Since long ago, mankind has fought using the technology of cannons, but even such firepower couldn’t stop the Titans.

Even if a Titan’s head gets blown off, it will regenerate in one or two minutes, though individual differences do exist.
Thomas
That’s crazy…
Franz
As if their size wasn’t enough to handle…
Marco
Instructor, are the Titans invulnerable?
Instructor
They are not. There is one way to defeat a Titan.

Target them here.
[Action: The instructor draws a circle around the back of the neck of a drawing of a Titan.]
Instructor
If significant damage is inflicted to this area, the Titan will die without regenerating.

To cut through their flesh, we use double blades like these.

If the attack reaches their weak point, the Titan won’t have time to regenerate and will die soon.


[Scene: Back to present day, on the battlefield. Eren, Armin, Mina, Thomas, Milieus, and Nack are standing on the roof of a building.]
Eren
Hey, Armin!

Don’t you think this is a great chance?

If we prove ourselves here in this first battle, before even entering the Recon Corps, surely they’ll promote us right up the ladder!
Armin
Yeah! Without a doubt!
Mina
Not to burst your bubble, but quite a few of us are aiming for the Recon Corps this year!
Thomas
I lagged behind you earlier, Eren, but I’m not losing this time!
Eren
That’s the spirit, Thomas!
Thomas
Let’s have a contest to see who can slay more Titans!
Eren
No fudging your numbers!
Soldier
Squad 34, advance! Assist the frontline guard!
Eren
Right! Let’s go!
Squad 34
Yeah!
[Action: Eren, Armin, Mina, Thomas, Milieus, and Nack fly off the building toward the wall.]
Mina
The Titans advanced this far?!
Thomas
The front guard’s already been crushed?!
Nack
What are our glory hound seniors doing?!
Eren
(Thoughts) I expected the situation to be bad, but this…

An abnormal one! Watch out!
[Action: An Abnormal jumps from a building toward the group. Eren, Armin, Mina, Milieus, and Nack land on a nearby building. The Abnormal looks around from behind the building, holding Thomas in its mouth.]
Thomas
H-Huh…?
[Action: The Abnormal swallows Thomas.]
Eren
How dare you!
[Action: Eren heads toward the Abnormal.]
Armin
Eren!
Milieus
Stop! Don’t go alone!
[Action: Armin, Mina, Milieus, and Nack follow Eren.]
Eren
Stop, you bastard!

How dare you eat Thomas! You’re not getting away!
[Action: While heading toward the Abnormal, another Titan bites Eren’s leg off from below. Eren lands on the building.]
Armin
Eren!
Nack
Ah!
Mina
Eren!
[Action: Another Titan grabs Nack out of the air. A third Titan grabs the wire of Mina’s 3D Maneuver Gear, pulling her back. A fourth Titan grabs Milieus.]
Milieus
Stop! Please stop!
[Action: Eren falls to his knees on a building upon seeing Eren’s body.]
Armin
(Thoughts) Why… am I… watching… as my comrades… get eaten?
[Action: A Titan comes up to the building Armin is standing on. It picks up Armin and holds it over its mouth.]
Armin
(Thoughts) Why… won’t my body… move?
[Action: The Titan drops Armin into its mouth.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Armin…




[Scene: A flashback to Eren’s childhood days. Armin is holding a book.]
Armin
Eren! Eren! Eren!
Eren
What is it now, Armin?
Armin
Look at this book my grandpa was hiding!

It’s all about the outside world!
Eren
The outside world? But that’s forbidden, isn’t it?

What if the Military Police find out?
Armin
Who cares about that now?

According to this book, most of the world is covered by a huge amount of water called “sea”! And it’s all salty water, too!
Eren
Salt? You’re making stuff up now!

Salt is a treasure! The merchants would’ve exhausted the supply!
Armin
The “sea” is so vast, they can’t ever deplete it all!
Eren
No way.
Armin
There’s more than just mountains of salt!

Fire water! A continent of ice! Snowfields of sand!

The world out there must be far more vast than the outside of the walls!
Eren
The outside world…
Armin
And guess what! This is a secret, but my parents are going to the outside world soon!
Eren
The outside world…
Armin
Right, Eren?

It’d be great if we could explore the outside world, too, someday.


[Scene: Back to present day on the battlefield. Eren musters up the strength to dive into the mouth of the Titan swallowing Armin. He grabs Armin’s wrist and throws him back out to the building.]
Armin
Eren!
Eren
You think I’m gonna die here?!

Hey, Armin…
[Action: Eren reaches out his arm from the Titan’s mouth.]
Eren
You told me about it…

So I’m going… to the outside world…
[Action: Armin crawls forward toward Eren.]
Armin
Eren! Hurry!
[Action: The Titan bites down on Eren’s arm, sending it flying toward Armin.]






[Scene: On the battlefield at Trost, on the roof of a building. Armin has witnessed Eren being eaten by a Titan and is in a daze.]
Connie
Hey. Hey!

What’s wrong, Armin?

Snap out of it! Hey!

Armin!

Hey. Armin! Hey!
[Action: Armin snaps out of his daze.]
Armin
Ah!
Connie
You awake? Feeling alright?

Does it hurt anywhere? What about your squad?
Armin
Squad?
Connie
Come on, get a hold of yourself. Why are you alone?

Your body feels kind of slimy. What in the world happened?
[Action: Armin remembers what happened to Eren and the rest of his comrades.]
Armin
Augh!!!!

I’m dead weight! I should just die!
Connie
Hey, calm down, Armin!
Armin
Damn it!
Connie
Where’s everyone?
Armin
Ah!
Ymir
That’s enough, Connie.

They’re all dead, minus this guy.
Connie
Shut up! Armin hasn’t said anything yet!
Ymir
Isn’t it obvious from just looking around?

We don’t have any more time to waste on him.
Connie
Why is Armin the only survivor?
Ymir
Hell if I know. Maybe they thought he was a corpse.

While I think it’s unfortunate they ran into a swarm of Titans, the fact that Eren and the others died while this incompetent one survived is ridiculous.
Connie
Hey, you bitch.

Want me to shut you up for good?!
Krista
Stop it, both of you!

I’m sure we’re all just shaken up.

A bunch of our friends are suddenly dying, after all! It’s only natural!
Ymir
That’s my Krista!

Marry me once this operation is over! Hahaha!
Connie
True, she’s screwing around more than usual.

Anyway, we can’t just sit around here. Can you stand, Armin?
[Action: Connie holds out his hand for Armin. Armin stands on his own and begins walking off.]
Armin
Sorry for being a burden.

I’ll join the rear guard.
Connie
H-Hey… Armin!
[Action: Armin jumps off the building and uses his 3DMG to make his way through the city.]
Soldier
Let’s move, Connie! Our orders are to keep advancing!
[Action: Connie and his squad leave the area.]


[Scene: In the city. Armin flies around buildings with his 3DMG.]
Armin
(Thoughts) This is hell.

(Thoughts) Wait, that’s nothing new.

(Thoughts) I just wasn’t aware of it until now. This world has always been hell.
[Action: Armin remembers all the times he’s been bullied.]
Armin
(Thoughts) The strong prey on the weak.

(Thoughts) It’s so mercifully simple.

(Thoughts) But… my friends… sought the strength to live in this world.

(Thoughts) They saved a weakling like me. I couldn’t bear that.

(Thoughts) To them, I’m just someone who needs protection.

(Thoughts) I wanted to be strong like them, so I could stand as their equal and survive in this world.
[Action: Armin’s 3DMG misfires, sending him flying into a building and crashing to the ground.]
Armin
Ah! Ah… ugh!

(Thoughts) And this is all my feelings amounted to.

(Thoughts) Because of me, Eren was…
[Action: Nearby, Hanna is performing CPR on Franz.]
Hanna
Urgh… urgh… urgh…!
Armin
Hanna… what are you…?
Hanna
Armin, help me! Franz isn’t breathing!

I’ve been trying to resuscitate him over and over again, but Franz isn’t…!
Armin
Hanna, it’s dangerous here, so let’s just --
Hanna
I can’t just leave Franz like this!
Armin
No, Hanna… Franz is…
[Action: Hanna continues performing CPR on Franz.]
Armin
Please… just stop.

There’s nothing more… that can be done for him.


[Scene: At the base of Wall Rose. A merchant boss is trying to push his caravan through the wall’s gates while residents are trying to evacuate.]
Man
H-Hey, you guys! Do you understand the situation we’re in?
Boss
We’re only doing this because we understand!

If you want to live, help push!
Residents
Quit screwing around!

That won’t fit no matter how you push it!

You should let the people through first!

The Titans will devour us all at this rate!

What the hell are you doing, soldier?!

Arrest those men!
[Action: The angry residents push a soldier to the front of the crowd.]
Soldier
B-But…
Boss
Just try it, flunky. I’m the boss of the company here.
Soldier
Uh, well…
Boss
Who do you think provides the meals you soldiers shit out?

Can you pay to feed all the soldiers in this town?

All of you, push!

The goods here are worth more than what you could ever make in your petty lives!

If you cooperate, you’ll be rewarded!
[Action: In the crowd, a woman hugs her worried child.]
Woman
It’s alright.

Your father will shoot all the Titans down with his cannon.
Child
Mom, look.
Woman
Huh?
[Action: Residents can hear footsteps in the distance. Suddenly, a large Aberrant comes running around the corner of a street toward the crowd. The residents begin to scream.]
Boss
Push it through! If you don’t want to die, push it through!
[Action: The residents begin to push frantically. A group of soldiers chases the Titan from behind.]
Soldier 1
Damn, why is it ignoring us?!
Soldier 2
It’s an Aberrant! Don’t think too much about it!
Soldier 3
It’s fast! Even we elites can’t catch up to it?!
Soldier 4
At this rate…
[Action: From behind the other soldiers, Mikasa races ahead. She latches onto the neck of the Aberrant and slices through.]
Mikasa
Yah!
[Action: The Aberrant falls just before it reaches the crowd. Mikasa notices the crowd of residents and the merchants trying to push their caravan through.]
Mikasa
What… are you doing?
Boss
Oh, perfect timing. Hey you, make these people help me out!

I’ll reward you handsomely!
Mikasa
My comrades are dying right now.

Because the evacuation is lagging, they’re fighting the Titans and dying.
Boss
Course they are!

It’s your duty to offer your lives to protect citizens and their property, is it not?!

Don’t get full of yourselves just because you freeloaders are finally doing your job after a hundred years!
[Action: Mikasa hops down from the Aberrant’s head. She begins walking through the crowd toward the merchant boss.]
Mikasa
If you think it’s natural for people to die for others, I’m sure you’ll understand that at times, the sacrifice of a single precious life can save many others.
Boss
Just try me!

I’ve known your employer for many years.

You don’t know how easy it’d be for me to order you underlings around!
[Action: The merchant boss’s henchmen rush toward Mikasa. She easily knocks them out with a blow to their backs and continues walking toward the merchant boss.]
Mikasa
How can a corpse be speaking?
[Action: Mikasa raises her blade but stops at his neck before she strikes the man.]
Boss
Wait!
Henchman
P-President…
Boss
Move the wagon.
[Action: The caravan is moved, and the residents begin to evacuate.]
Child
Thanks, sis!
Woman
We’re saved thanks to you. Thank you so much.
[Action: Mikasa puts her blades away and places her hand over her heart before walking away.]
[Scene: Some time later. It begins to rain hard. The Aberrant begins to dissolve.]
Ian
Good work taking it down, Ackermann. I’m impressed.
Mikasa
Thank you very much.

However… I dulled my blades with a single blow in my impatience.

I’ll be more mindful next time.
Ian
Just what kind of life have you been living until now…

Never mind, it’s nothing.
[Action: Mikasa pulls her scarf up over her nose. She remembers the child and mother from earlier, along with a couple from her childhood.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) Why am I remembering that now?








[Scene: In the past, at a cabin in the forest. A young Mikasa and her parents, the couple that she remembered, are embroidering.]
Mikasa
Finished!

Mom, have a look!
Mother
My, you did a splendid job, Mikasa. It’s beautiful.

This embroidery has been passed down our family for generations.

If you have children someday, teach it to them.
Mikasa
How do you have children?
Mother
Well, you should ask your father.
Father
Huh?
Mikasa
Hey, Dad.
Father
Uh, well, Dad isn’t so sure either.

Ah right, Dr. Jaeger will be here soon, so why don’t we ask him?
[Action: Someone knocks at the door.]
Father
Oh, looks like he’s here already.
[Action: Another knock at the door comes.]
Father
Coming!


[Scene: It is raining. A young Eren and his father Grisha are visiting the Ackermann house. Grisha knocks on the door and waits.]
Eren
Mikasa?
Grisha
That’s right. She’s a girl your age.

There aren’t any other children around here, so get along with her.
Eren
That depends on her attitude.
Grisha
Eren, this is why you only have one friend.

Maybe they’re not home.
[Action: Grisha knocks on the door again.]
Grisha
Mr. Ackermann, it’s Dr. Jaeger.
[Action: Grisha opens the door.]
Grisha
Pardon the intrusion.

What?!
[Action: Grisha remains stunned at what he sees.]
Eren
What’s wrong?

Hey, Dad?
[Action: Grisha enters the house and checks on Mikasa’s mother. She is dead.]
Grisha
It’s no good.

Eren, is there a girl nearby? Did you see Mikasa?
Eren
No.
Grisha
I see…

I’m going to go call the Military Police Brigade and request an investigation.

You wait at the base of the mountain.

Understand, Eren?

Eren!


[Scene: Elsewhere in the forest, at a different cabin. Young Mikasa lies on her side, tied up on the floor.]
Man 1
Hey, is she really going to be worth anything?

We killed both her parents to nab her…
Man 2
Take a good look at her face.
[Action: One of the men kicks Mikasa over onto her back.]
Man 1
Not bad but she’s still just a kid. Doesn’t strike my fancy.
Man 2
I don’t care about your tastes. She’s an Oriental.

In the past, there were different human races.

She’s the last descendant of a family that escaped to the walls from the Orient.

We’ll auction her to some perverted patron at the underground market of the capital.

The other Orientals have been wiped out, so she should fetch a handsome price.
Man 1
Her dad didn’t look like an Oriental.

I doubt she’s pure-blooded.
[Action: The second man stomps his foot in anger.]
Man 2
Exactly. Her mom would’ve been the real jackpot!

You just had to freak out and kill her!
Man 1
I-I didn’t have a choice! She was putting up a fight!
Man 2
Is that your best excuse?! Huh?!


[Scene: Mikasa remembers back to what just happened at the Ackermann house.]
Father
Dr. Jaeger, we’ve been wait --
[Action: A knife is stabbed into Mikasa’s father’s chest. Mikasa’s father stumbles backward from the door and falls to the ground.]
Mother
Hmm?
Man 2
Why, hello there.
[Action: Mikasa’s mother can only watch in stunned silence as she sees the knife covered in Mikasa’s father’s blood. She begins reaching for the pair of sewing scissors.]
Man 1
You’d be wise to listen to us.

Unless you want your head split in half by this --
[Action: Mikasa’s mother grabs the pair of scissors and runs for the two men.]
Mother
Aughhh!!!
Man 1
This bitch…!
Mother
Mikasa, run away!
Mikasa
M-Mom…
Mother
Mikasa, hurry!
Mikasa
Um…

Dad…?
Man 1
Damn it, that’s enough!
[Action: The man attacks Mikasa’s mother with his axe, killing Mikasa’s mother in one blow. Mikasa watches as her mother falls to the ground.]
Man 2
What the hell, man?! I told you we’d only kill the dad!
Man 1
But she was --
Man 2
Quit your excuses! Nab the brat!
[Action: The man with the axe steps over Mikasa’s mother’s body.]
Man 1
Hey, now you’d better behave.

Otherwise… I’ll do this!
[Action: The man punches Mikasa out cold.]


[Scene: Back at the cabin where Mikasa is on the floor.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) It’s cold…
[Action: The front door opens, surprising the two kidnappers.]
Eren
Excuse me.
[Action: The man with the axe walks toward the door.]
Man 1
Hey, you brat! What are you doing here?!
Eren
Um, uh… I was lost in the forest… and I saw this cabin…
[Action: The man with the axe looks toward the other kidnapper. The other kidnapper waves his hand in dismissal.]
Man 1
A kid shouldn’t be walking around in the forest alone.

There are scary wolves roaming around here.

But you won’t have anything to worry about if you come with --
[Action: Eren stabs the man with the axe with a knife.]
Eren
Thanks, Mister.

I get it now, so die, you bastard!
[Action: Eren pulls out his knife, and the man with the axe falls to the ground.]
Man 2
What?! You kidding me?!
[Action: Eren goes into a side room and closes the door slowly.]
Man 2
C-Come back, you damn brat!
[Action: The man picks up the axe from the dead man and opens the door to the room where Eren is hiding. Before he can run away, Eren runs at him with a sharp edge attached to the end of a broom and stabs the man. After he pushes the man out of the room with his makeshift spear, he continues to stab the man repeatedly with his knife.]
Eren
Urahhh!!!

You goddamn animals!

Die! Die!
[Action: Mikasa turns to see Eren stabbing her kidnappers and can only watch in horror.]
Eren
This is what you deserve!

You had it coming!

Stay down for good!
[Action: After Eren kills the second man, he wipes his face.]
Eren
It’s alright now. Don’t worry.
[Action: Eren goes over to Mikasa and cuts the bindings around her wrists.]
Eren
You’re Mikasa, right? I’m Eren.

I’m Dr. Jaeger’s son. I’m sure you’ve met him before.

I tagged along with him to your house for medical examinations.

And there…
[Action: Eren completely removes Mikasa’s bindings. She rubs her wrists.]
Mikasa
There should have been a third man.
Eren
What?
[Action: Mikasa and Eren hear footsteps coming. They look up to find a third man towering over them. Eren races for his knife, but the man kicks him before he can get it. Mikasa can only watch in fear.]
Man 3
Did you do it?
[Action: The man grabs Eren but his shirt collar and begins choking him.]
Man 3
Did you do it?! Did you?!

I’ll kill you! You’re dead meat!
Eren
F-Fight…
Mikasa
Huh…?
Eren
Fight!

If you lose, you die.

If you win, you live.
Man 3
What are you thinking, you brat?!
Eren
If you don’t fight, you can’t win!
[Action: Mikasa grabs the knife and stands. She hesitates.]
Mikasa
I can’t do it!

(Thoughts) At that moment, I remembered…

(Thoughts) I’d witnessed this scene before… time and time again.

(Thoughts) It’s always been unfolding before me.

(Thoughts) But I turned a blind eye to it.

(Thoughts) That’s right. This world is… cruel.
[Action: Mikasa steadies herself.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) At that instant, my body stopped shaking.

(Thoughts) Since then, I’ve had complete control over my body.

(Thoughts) I thought I could do anything.

(Thoughts) Fight… Fight… Fight!
[Action: Mikasa clutches the knife with ferocity and stabs the final man.]


[Scene: Sometime later, at night. The Military Police are investigating the cabin where Eren and Mikasa killed their attackers. Grisha, Eren, and Mikasa wait outside.]
Soldier 1
His heart was pierced from the back with one strike.
Soldier 2
Those kids did this?
Grisha
Eren, I told you to wait at the base of the mountain.

Do you understand what you’ve done?!
Eren
I killed some dangerous animals.

They were beasts that just happened to look human!
Grisha
Eren!
Eren
They would’ve been long gone if we’d waited for the Military Police Brigade to arrive.

It would’ve been too late!
Grisha
That’s no excuse!

You were just lucky, Eren!

I’m scolding you for thoughtlessly risking your life like that!
Eren
But… I wanted to save her quickly…
[Action: Grisha is stunned at Eren’s words. He stands up to talk to Mikasa.]
Grisha
Mikasa. Do you remember me? We’ve met a few times when you were younger.
Mikasa
Dr. Jaeger, which way… should I go to return home?

It’s cold.

There’s nowhere… for me to go home to.
[Action: Eren walks to Mikasa. He takes off his scarf and wraps it around Mikasa’s neck and head.]
Eren
You can have this.

It’s warm, right?
Mikasa
It’s warm.
Grisha
Mikasa, why don’t you live with us?
Mikasa
Huh?
Grisha
You’ve been through a lot. You need a lot of rest.
[Action: Mikasa looks at Eren.]
Eren
What?
[Action: Eren takes Mikasa’s hand.]
Eren
Come on, let’s head back already. To our home.
Mikasa
Okay.


[Scene: Present day. Mikasa moves through the city, cutting down Titans.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) A cruel world where only the victors can survive.
Ian
We’re withdrawing, Ackermann. Climb up the wall.
Mikasa
I’ll support the vanguard’s withdrawal.
Ian
Hey, Ackermann!
[Action: Mikasa flies off the roof.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) But I have a place to return to in this world.

(Thoughts) Eren, if you’re here, I can do anything.


Armin
(Narration) Over a century ago, mankind had to face a new enemy.

(Narration) The difference of power between mankind and the newfound enemy was overwhelming. Soon, mankind was driven to the brink of extinction.

(Narration) The surviving humans built three walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina. They then lived the next century in peace, under their protection.

(Narration) However, in year 845, the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan appeared out of nowhere. Instantly, the walls were shattered, along with the peace of everyday life.

(Narration) Mankind abandoned Wall Maria.

(Narration) They lost a fifth of the population and a third of their territory as human activity was pushed back to Wall Rose.

(Narration) In year 850, the Colossal Titan once again appeared out of nowhere and broke the wall, allowing for the further advance of the Titans.

(Narration) In two hours, the evacuation of civilians was completed.

(Narration) No one fell victim to the Titans, with the exception of the soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the defense.








[Scene: In the cellar of a supply compound. A group of young soldiers is trying to stop Kitz and another group of soldiers from leaving.]
Soldier 1
Please stop, Commander!

If the Titans attacked, we support soldiers won’t be able to hold the place by ourselves!
Soldier 2
Please stay with us!
Kitz
Get out of my way. I must leave to oversee the organization of the reinforcements.
Soldier 2
Ngh…
Soldier 1
Behind the safer inner gate?
Kitz
What the hell are you trying to say?

My actions adhere to the regulations. I am just following the rules! It is what soldiers are supposed to do!
Soldier 2
But if this place falls --
Kitz
Silence!
[Action: Kitz points his blade at the young soldiers.]
Soldier 2
Ah!
Kitz
If you say one more word, I will consider it as treason and punish you accordingly!


[Scene: On the battlefield. Mikasa makes her way onto the roof of a building and sees a group of fellow soldiers.]
Mikasa
Huh?

(Thoughts) They should’ve heard the bells that signalled for retreat, so why aren’t they climbing the wall yet?

Ah!
[Action: Mikasa looks toward a supply compound. It is being overtaken by Titans.]


[Scene: In a building. A group of soldiers is hiding behind some desks in a room. A Titan peers through the window at them.]
Soldier 1
This is the end… We’re done for.
[Action: Somewhere on the building, a bunch of glass breaks, and the Titans growl. One of the soldiers is fiddling with a gun.]
Soldier 2
Great.
Soldier 3
What’s the point of that?

Wha…?
[Action: The soldier with the gun puts the gun into his mouth and fires. The other soldiers in the group scream and cry.]


[Scene: Back on the battlefield. Connie and Jean are on the roof of a building with a bunch of other soldiers.]
Connie
Hey, Jean! What do we do now?
Jean
What can we do?

We finally received the order to retreat, but we can’t get over the wall because we’re out of gas.

We’re all going to die.

Thanks to those fucking cowards…
Connie
You mean the support squads?

What happened to them? Are they all dead?
Jean
They probably lost their will to fight. I understand how they feel.

But I doubt they’ve abandoned their mission and barricaded themselves away in the HQ.

I’m guessing the Titans have them surrounded, which is why they can’t supply us with gas.
Connie
That’s exactly why we have no choice but to go all in on those Titans!

Sitting here and waiting to die isn’t going to make a difference! The Titans are going to surround us, too!

If we keep running away from them, we’d just end up wasting the little gas we have left.

Once we lose our agility, it’d really be over!
Jean
I never thought I’d hear you make an intelligent comment, Connie.

But how do you suppose we do that with the forces we have left?

The vanguard has nearly been wiped out.

Moreover, which one of us cadets could possibly take command of such an operation?

Not that we could do anything about the Titans even if someone took command.

The gas storage is probably crawling with 4-meter class Titans by now.

And of course we can’t fight them inside the storage.
Connie
Krr… So it’s hopeless?
Jean
I had such a boring life. If someone told me beforehand…
Sasha
Let’s do it!

Stand up! If we all work together, we can do it! I’ll be in front!
[Action: None of the soldiers make a move. Sasha looks around and sees Armin sitting alone. She makes her way over to him.]
Sasha
Armin! Let’s go together and --
[Action: She stops when she sees Armin’s face with a look of dejection and derealization.]
Annie
What now, Reiner?
Reiner
It’s not time yet. We must group up first.
Marco
It’s over…

No matter what we do, we’ll be dead before we make it out of here.

I mean, I’m prepared to die… but what exactly am I going to die for?
[Action: Mikasa arrives at the scene. She runs to the group on the roof.]
Soldier 1
Mikasa? Weren’t you in the rearguard?
Mikasa
Annie!
Annie
Hmm?
Mikasa
I think I understand the situation.

And I apologize for bothering you, but have you seen Eren’s unit?
Annie
No, and I haven’t seen anyone climb the wall either.
Reiner
Armin’s over there, though.
[Action: Mikasa sees Armin sitting alone.]
Mikasa
Armin!
Armin
Oh!

(Thoughts) Mikasa?! Crap! How can I look her in the face?

(Thoughts) I don’t even deserve to be alive.

(Thoughts) If I knew it’d come to this… I should’ve just died with him!
[Action: Mikasa makes her way over to Armin and kneels beside him. Armin can’t bring himself to look at her.]
Mikasa
Armin, are you hurt? Are you feeling okay?
[Action: Armin continues to look down and says nothing. Mikasa gets up.]
Mikasa
Hmm… Where’s Eren?

Armin?
[Action: Armin finally looks up to Mikasa with tears streaming down his face. Mikasa is alarmed but comes to realize what has happened.]
Armin
Our unit… The 34th cadet unit…

Thomas Wagner, Nic Tius, Mylius Zeramuski, Mina Carolina, Eren Jaeger.

All five of them have fulfilled their duty and died heroic deaths in battle!
[Action: The other soldiers only watch.]
Sasha
No way…
Soldier 2
So the 34th unit was nearly wiped out…
Soldier 3
If we fight the Titans, we’ll end up like them.
Armin
I’m sorry, Mikasa.

Eren died in my stead… I couldn’t do anything!

I’m so sorry!
[Action: Mikasa kneels down and places her hand on Armin’s.]
Mikasa
Armin.
Armin
Huh…?
Mikasa
Calm down.

This isn’t the time to be emotional.
Armin
Huh?
Mikasa
Stand up.
[Action: Mikasa stands up and helps Armin to get up. After he does, Mikasa walks off.]
Mikasa
Marco. If we take out the Titans around the HQ, we can replenish our gas supplies and climb the wall.

Does that sound correct?
Marco
Yeah…

But even if you’re with us, there are just too many.
Mikasa
We can do it.
Marco
Huh?
[Action: Mikasa draws her blades and stands in front of the other soldiers with one blade pointed to the sky.]
Mikasa
I am strong. Stronger than all of you. Extremely strong.

I can kill all those Titans there. Even if I’m alone.

You’re either incompetent, or you’re spineless cowards.

How pathetic. You can sit here and suck on your fingers. Yeah, do that.
Soldier 4
Hey, Mikasa! What are you saying?
Soldier 5
You wanna fight all those Titans by yourself?
Soldier 6
There’s no way you can do that!
Mikasa
If I can’t, then I’ll just die.

But if I win, I live.

Unless I fight, I cannot win.
Marco
Hey!
[Action: Mikasa jumps off the roof and flies off.]
Jean
Your oratory skills are what’s pathetic.

Was the point of that to shock us into action?

It’s all your fault, Eren!
[Action: Jean draws his blades and raises one to the sky.]
Jean
Hey! Were we trained to let our comrades fight alone?!

At this rate, we’re going to turn out to be spineless cowards!
Connie
Nrgh!
[Action: Jean moves to follow Mikasa. Connie follows after.]
Reiner
I’m surprised to hear him say that.
[Action: Reiner, Annie, Bertholdt, Marco, and Armin move to follow Mikasa.]
Sasha
Hey! Cowards! Weaklings! Idiots!
[Action: Sasha jumps off the roof.]
Soldier 1
(Thoughts) They’re nuts…

Dammit! Let’s do it!
[Action: The rest of the soldiers move to follow Mikasa. As Mikasa flies through the streets, she takes down Titans.]
Mikasa
Ugh!
Jean
Hurry! Follow Mikasa!

Let’s keep this fight short! We need to kill them all before we run out of gas!
Connie
Mikasa’s just amazing.

How can she move that fast?
Armin
(Thoughts) She’s using too much gas. She’ll run out right away.

(Thoughts) I don’t care how skilled she is… Without agility, we can’t do anything!

(Thoughts) She’s not in her usual cool-headed state… She wants to drown out her pain through action!

(Thoughts) If she keeps this up…

Ahh!
[Action: Armin sees Mikasa’s gas run out. She falls onto the roof of a building and drops her blades.]
Armin
Mikasa!
[Action: Armin flies off in Mikasa’s direction, away from the group.]
Jean
Dammit!
Connie
Jean! You lead the others!

I’ll go with Armin!
Jean
I’m coming with you!
Connie
What are you talking about? There are more Titans left!

We need your skills!
[Action: Connie flies off to follow Armin. Jean continues forward with the rest of the soldiers.]


[Scene: In the city, in an alleyway. Mikasa lies still on a projection on the side of a building.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) Again…

(Thoughts) It happened again…

(Thoughts) I lost my family once again…
[Action: Mikasa jumps off the projection and lands on the ground.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) This pain is familiar. Will I have to start fresh once again?
[Action: A Titan approaches.]






[Scene: On a building far from the supply building. Jean examines the situation.]
Jean
It’s no good. We won’t get close to the HQ.

Unless we’re prepared to make sacrifices.
Tom
Uuhu… Ahh!
Jean
Huh?
[Action: Jean looks down at a nearby street. He sees a soldier without gas trying to climb up a building.]
Jean
(Thoughts) Damn! He’s out of gas!

Ah!
[Action: Two Titans run to the soldier on the ground.]
Tom
Stay away!!
Jean
Ah…
Soldier 1
Tom! I’m going to save you!
[Action: A soldier flies in from behind Jean to go save Tom.]
Jean
Stop! You can’t!
[Action: Tom is grabbed by one of the Titans. The other soldier flies in, ready to attack.]
Soldier 1
Stop!
[Action: Another Titan grabs the other soldier mid-air.]
Soldier 1
Gah!
Tom
Ahhh!!
[Action: Tom is eaten by the Titan.]
Jean
(Thoughts) Why couldn’t I stop them?

(Thoughts) Why didn’t I stop them?

(Thoughts) If I had stopped them, even if by force… this wouldn’t happen.
[Action: Another soldier is captured by a Titan.]
Soldier 2
Ahhh!!
Jean
(Thoughts) Am I really cut out for this?

(Thoughts) Am I really cut out for a position with so much responsibility?
[Action: Jean, Marco, Sasha, Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie watch from the rooftop as other soldiers die.]


[Scene: In the city, where Mikasa is alone. She sits on the ground and removes the blade from her grip.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) This world is merciless…

(Thoughts) It is also very beautiful.

(Thoughts) I lived a good life.
[Action: A Titan approaches. Mikasa sits quietly as it reaches out to grab her. Before it can grab her, she cuts its hand. After she does, she jumps out of the way before it can crush her.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) Huh?
[Action: The Titan reaches out to crush Mikasa again, but she jumps out of the way into a wall.]
Mikasa
Ugh!

(Thoughts) Why?
[Action: The Titan tries to crush Mikasa against the wall, but she evades again. Mikasa lands on the ground and rolls to a stop.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) I thought I’d given up.

Ugh!

(Thoughts) Why am I still standing?

(Thoughts) Why am I struggling?

(Thoughts) Why?
[Action: The Titan tries to get up, but it falls over. Mikasa stands up.]
Mikasa
My life has no meaning anymore.

(Thoughts) What’s keeping me going?

Ugh!
[Action: The Titan gets back up and moves toward Mikasa. Mikasa turns around to flee, but another Titan, the Attack Titan, blocks off her path.]
Eren
(Flashback) Fight! Fight… Fight!
Mikasa
Eren…
[Action: The Attack Titan continues forward toward the other Titan.]
Eren
(Flashback) Fight! You must fight! Fight! Fight!!
Mikasa
Ahh!

(Thoughts) I’m sorry, Eren. I won’t give up.

(Thoughts) I’ll never give up again.

(Thoughts) If I died, I won’t be able to remember you.

(Thoughts) So I’ll win, no matter what! I’ll survive, no matter what!

Uraaaa!!
[Action: Mikasa takes her broken blade and prepares to charge forward. However, the Attack Titan steps forward, nearly crushing Mikasa but sending her into the air, and punches the other Titan. Mikasa lands on the ground.]
Mikasa
Ugh!

What’s going on?

Ahh!
[Action: Mikasa looks up to see the Attack Titan.]
Attack.Titan
Uoarrrr!!

Uahh!!!
[Action: Mikasa covers her ears when the Attack Titan roars. When Mikasa looks up, she sees the Attack Titan walk forward and rips the other Titan’s body apart.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) A Titan… is killing… another Titan.

Ahh…
[Scene: Elsewhere in the city. Armin flies through the streets.]
Armin
(Thoughts) Please be alright, Mikasa!
Attack.Titan
Uoaaa!!
[Action: Armin hears a Titan roar. He turns to see Mikasa sitting on the ground.]
Armin
Ah! Mikasa!
[Action: Armin goes to get Mikasa. The two of them land on a rooftop. The two of them sit up.]
Armin
Mikasa, are you hurt?
[Action: Connie lands on the rooftop with them.]
Connie
Are you guys okay?!
Armin
Yeah!
Connie
We have to get going!

Ah!
[Action: A tall Titan appears. The Attack Titan also makes its way toward the tall Titan.]
Connie
Shit! This is bad!
Mikasa
No… That Titan’s…
Armin
Ah…
[Action: Armin looks down to see the disappearing body of another Titan.]
Armin
Huh?
Attack.Titan
Aaaah!!
Titan
Uoooooh!!
[Action: The Attack Titan takes up a fighting stance. Mikasa, Armin, and Connie look on with confusion.]
Titan
Uoaaaaah!!
[Action: The tall Titan charges forward, but the Attack Titan punches the other Titan. The other Titan’s head goes flying off and crashes into a building in the distance. The Attack Titan’s hand is destroyed but quickly regenerates. The body of the other Titan tries to get up, but the Attack Titan smashes its body with its foot.]
Armin
It finished the other Titan off? It knew of a Titan’s weak point?
Connie
We have to get going before it comes this way!
Armin
No… It doesn’t care about us.

It could’ve attacked us long ago.
Mikasa
It seemed like it had an idea of how to perform hand-to-hand combat.

What was that?!
Connie
Just consider it an Aberrant!

There’s just too much we don’t know.

Anyway, we must hurry to the HQ!
Armin
Wait! Mikasa’s out of gas!
Connie
Huh?! Are you fucking kidding me?! What are we gonna do without you?!
Armin
It’s obvious what we need to do.

I don’t have much gas left… You can take mine.
[Action: Armin takes the gas canister from his 3DMG and hooks it up to Mikasa’s gear.]
Mikasa
Armin!
Armin
There’s no other choice!

The gas is useless on me.

But…
Mikasa
Ah…
Armin
Please use it carefully this time. You must save everyone.
Mikasa
(Thoughts) I moved in without the determination to shoulder their lives.

(Thoughts) I even gave up on my life without realizing the responsibility I held.

(Thoughts) And it was all due to my own issues.

(Thoughts) I…
Armin
Alright!

Your maneuver gear is good to go. I gave you all of my blades as well.

Just leave one with me.

Now that I think about it, I don’t want to be eaten alive.
[Action: Mikasa takes the single blade that Armin kept for himself and throws it off the building.]
Armin
B-But…
[Action: Mikasa places her hand on Armin’s.]
Mikasa
Armin.
Armin
Huh?
Mikasa
I won’t leave you behind.
Armin
Huh?
[Action: Mikasa helps Armin up.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) At that moment… I was utterly confused.

(Thoughts) I’ve never heard about Titans killing their own kind.

(Thoughts) Then I was slightly exalted.

(Thoughts) Because what I was looking at… felt like the reification of mankind’s anger.


Armin
(Narration) In year 850, the Colossal Titan once again appeared out of nowhere and broke the wall, permitting the Titans to advance further.

(Narration) Soldiers fell one after another facing down the Titans.

(Narration) Then, Eren fell prey to a Titan as well.

(Narration) Just as Mikasa was cornered, a mysterious Titan suddenly appeared to fend off the other Titans.








[Scene: On the battlefield. Armin has finished replacing Mikasa’s 3DMG gas tanks with his. Connie waits nearby.]
Armin
Okay, your maneuver gear is good to go. I’ve given you all my blades, too.

Just leave me this one.

At the very least, I refuse to be eaten alive.
[Action: Mikasa takes the blade and throws it off the side of the building.]
Armin
Ah…

B-But…
Mikasa
Armin.
[Action: Mikasa places her hand on Armin’s,]
Armin
Huh?
Mikasa
I won’t leave you behind.
Armin
B-But with so many Titans around, you can’t possibly carry me along…
Connie
Let’s get going!
[Action: Connie takes Armin by the arm, and the trio runs toward the edge of the building.]
Armin
Ah!

(Thoughts) No! Please, let me go!

(Thoughts) I’ll just end up getting more of my friends killed.
Attack.Titan
Aaaah!!
[Action: Armin looks back at the Attack Titan and thinks.]
Armin
Ah! Wait!
[Action: Armin breaks away from Connie’s grip, and the trio stops.]
Armin
Listen to me! I’ve got a suggestion.
Connie
A suggestion?
Armin
It’s a two-person operation, so you two should decide whether to carry it out or not.

I know it’s crazy, but… couldn’t we use that Titan?
Connie
That Titan?
Armin
It’s only attacking other Titans. It seems uninterested in humans.

I was thinking of luring it to the supply tower somehow.

If it handles the other Titans for us, we could get everyone out of this alive!
Connie
Lure it? How would we even pull that off?
Armin
I think it acts on instinct.

If you two defeat the Titans in its vicinity, then it’ll start looking for other Titans.

Most likely, it’ll move towards the Titans swarming around Headquarters!
Connie
How could we do something so risky based on a mere guess?!
Armin
But if it does work, we could eliminate every Titan at HQ in one fell swoop!
Connie
Ah…
Mikasa
It’s at least worth a shot.
Connie
Wha?! Are you serious?!
Mikasa
If we’re facing certain death either way, the path to take is the path with a chance of victory.

Let’s go with Armin’s plan.
Armin
Ah…!
Connie
You want to side with a Titan to fight against Titans?
Mikasa
Yes. Precisely.
Connie
It won’t even be funny if we fail.
Armin
But if we succeed, everyone will be saved.
Mikasa
Make up your mind.
[Action: Mikasa runs in the direction of the Attack Titan. Armin follows after her.]
Connie
I get it! Dammit, I get it!


[Scene: Elsewhere on the battlefield. Jean stands on the rooftop of a building, watching a group of Titans surrounding a soldier.]
Jean
(Thoughts) Am I really cut out for this?

(Thoughts) Can I handle a position with this much responsibility?

(Thoughts) No! Wait!

(Thoughts) The Titans are relatively concentrated around there.

(Thoughts) This is our chance!

Go! Hurry to HQ while you can!
[Action: Jean jumps off the roof to a lower building and runs toward HQ. Marco, Sasha, Reiner, Bertolt, and Annie follow.]
Jean
(Thoughts) It’s now or never! We’re finished if our gas runs out!

Everyone! Move in!
[Scene: On the battlefield with Mikasa, Connie, and Armin. The trio is leading the Attack Titan toward remaining Titans and toward the HQ. In the other part of the battlefield, Jean leads the group.]
Marco
Jean!
Jean
Huh?
Marco
Thanks! I only got out because of you!
Jean
Huh?
Marco
It’s all thanks to you!

I told you before, didn’t I? You’re cut out to be a leader!
Jean
Haha…

I seriously don’t know.
[Action: Jean and the rest of the soldiers continue to make their way toward HQ. One soldier gets caught by a Titan.]
Soldier 1
Ugh! Uwaa!!
Jean
Ahh…

Dammit!
[Action: Jean looks back, but only for a moment. He continues forward and bursts through a window of the HQ. Other soldiers follow after him.]
Jean
(Thoughts) How many of us made it?

(Thoughts) Using the deaths of our comrades…

(Thoughts) How many died under my command…?
[Action: Jean looks to his left to see two soldiers hiding under a desk.]
Jean
You’re part of the supply squad, aren’t you?
[Action: Jean grabs the collar of one of the soldiers and drags him out from under the desk. Jean punches the soldier.]
Jean
Urgh!
Soldier 2
Uwaa!
Marco
Stop it, Jean!
[Action: Marco locks Jean’s arms from behind.]
Jean
These bastards abandoned us!

Do you even have a clue how many died?!
Soldier 3
The Titans invaded the supply depot!

What could we have done?!
Jean
It’s your job to figure something out!
[Action: The sound of a heavy object flying can be heard.
Reiner
Take cover!
Jean
Huh?
[Action: At one end of the HQ, a Titan’s head hits the building wall and breaks it open, sending a soldier flying.]
Soldier 4
Ahh!
Jean
Dammit! There are too many people gathered here!
[Action: The soldiers in the building panic and run toward the inner rooms. Jean is frozen in place as he stares at the faces of the Titans who wait outside the building.]
Soldiers
Hurry! Inside!

Run for your lives!

Where’s Mikasa?!

She crashed back there! She’s been eaten!
Jean
(Thoughts) This is normal… This is reality, isn’t it?

(Thoughts) Was I just chasing a delusional dream?

(Thoughts) I thought I knew reality.

(Thoughts) Just thinking about it, it’s obvious…

(Thoughts) There’s no way to beat these gigantic monstrosities.

Ahh…!
[Action: A fist slams into the face of the Titan on Jean’s right.]
Jean
What?!
[Action: Outside the building, the Attack Titan punches the two Titans away from the hole.]
Attack.Titan
Aaaaah!!
Jean
What… is that?
[Action: Mikasa, Connie, and Armin smash through a window and land inside the building.]
Jean
Ah… Mikasa!
Connie
That was close… It’s empty…

We did it! We just barely made it!
Jean
You’re… all alive?
[Action: Connie pats Armin hard on the back.]
Connie
We did it, Armin!
Armin
Ouch!
Connie
Your plan was a success!

Everyone! That Titan’s an Aberrant that slaughters other Titans!

It’s not even interested in attacking humans!

If we play our cards right, we can all get out of here alive!
Soldier 5
We’d… use the Titan?
Jean
You’d rely on a Titan’s help? That’s more delusional than any dream!
Mikasa
It’s not a dream.

I don’t care if it’s an Aberrant or whatever.

Just let it rampage here for as long as possible.
[Action: Outside, the Attack Titan continues to attack the other Titans.]
Attack.Titan
Aaaaah!!
Mikasa
Realistically, that’s our best option for survival.








[Scene: At the HQ. The Attack Titan continues to fight other Titans. In the HQ’s basement, a lift to the storage below the basement is being raised while the soldiers are gathered.]
Attack.Titan
Uuaaaaah!!
Connie
It’s okay. That Titan’s stronger than average.

They can’t take over the building while it’s rampaging outside.
Reiner
How much do you know about that Titan?
Connie
Huh?

Shouldn’t we discuss that after we’re safe?
Reiner
True that. Let’s get out of here alive first.
Jean
We found some!
[Action: Jean and some other soldiers holding some boxes come out of a storage room.]
Jean
They’re Military Police supplies, though they’re covered in dust…
[Action: Jean puts together one of the rifles from the storage room.]
Jean
Will these bullets be enough?

Do these guns even work against the Titans in the first place?
Armin
It’s better than nothing.

Even if there are still seven 3- to 4-meter class Titans in the supply room, blinding them all at once isn’t impossible with this much firepower.

First, we’ll use the lift to lower a large number of people into the center of the chamber.

Next, they’ll fire directly into the faces of all seven Titans at once.

We’ll blind them.

The next instance will decide everything.

Seven other people hiding near the ceiling will swoop down to attack their weak spots while they’re blind.

In other words, if we follow this plan, we’ll be gambling everything on this single attack.

The whole point is for seven people to kill all seven Titans simultaneously.

The seven people should be the most physically capable ones, but you’ll have to shoulder the burden of everyone’s lives…

I’m sorry…
Reiner
No problem.
Annie
Whoever fails, all of us will die. The risk is the same.
Armin
But… I’m a nobody. Is my plan really the best option?
Marco
We’ve got no other choices except your plan.

There’s no time left to think. This idea’s our only shot.

Now we’ve just gotta give it everything we’ve got.
Mikasa
Don’t worry. Be confident.

You’ve got a talent for reasoning out the best solution.
Armin
Huh?
Mikasa
That intuition has saved my life before, and Eren’s life, too.
Armin
Huh? When?
[Action: A soldier opens the door to the lift.]
Soldier 1
The lift’s ready! The guns, too! All of them are loaded!
Mikasa
You just aren’t aware yet. I’ll tell you more later.
Armin
Okay…
[Action: The soldiers prepare to reclaim the storage basement.]
Connie
But can we really kill the Titans without our 3D Maneuver Gear?
Reiner
Sure we can. We’re only up against 3- to 4-meter class ones.

It’s easy to target their weak spot.
Jean
Yeah. Who cares how big they are? It’s always the spot at the nape of their necks.
Sasha
Length: 1 meter. Width: 10 centimeters!
Reiner
Or just ram your blade up their assholes. That’s their only other weak spot.
Connie
What?! I’ve never heard of that move!
Sasha
First time I’ve heard about it, too.
Jean
Reiner, those might just be your last words.


[Scene: In the storage basement. The lift is being lowered slowly with seven soldiers inside. The other seven soldiers wait on the supporting beams above.]
Marco
We’re all good. There’s still only seven.
[Action: Marco, Armin, and five other soldiers ready their rifles.]
Marco
Follow the plan!
[Action: A grinning Titan walks in front of the lift and stops. It turns suddenly to the soldiers in the lift.]
Soldier 1
Eeek!!
Marco
Calm down! Lure them in closer!

Hold…
[Action: The grinning Titan slowly comes closer to the soldiers in the lfit.]
Reiner
(Thoughts) We shouldn’t fight at a disadvantage.
Jean
(Thoughts) If we want to keep casualties to the bare minimum…
Connie
(Thoughts) … We must end it in this one strike!
[Action: The seven Titans slowly approach the soldiers in the lift.]
Marco
Wait…

Ready…
[Action: The grinning Titan takes one last step forward toward the lift.]
Marco
Fire!
[Action: The soldiers in the lift fire their rifles. The other soldiers waiting above descend to cut the necks of the Titans.]
Mikasa
Uugh!
[Action: Mikasa takes down her Titan.]
Mikasa
(Thoughts) I got mine… What about the others?
[Action: Three of the other Titans fall. The Titans that Connie and Sasha attacked do not fall and turn to look at the two. They begin to back away.]
Sasha
Pardon me… for suddenly… stabbing you… from behind…
Connie
Oh shit!
Bertolt
It’s Sasha and Connie!
Jean
Hurry! Help them!
Sasha
A-Ah…

I’m really sorry!
[Action: The Titan launches toward Sasha. Sasha rolls out of the way.]
Sasha
Ahh! I’m really sorry!

Uugh… Ah!
Mikasa
Ugh!
Annie
Hrgh!
[Action: Mikasa takes down the Titan attacking Sasha. Annie takes down the one attacking Connie.]
Sasha
Mikasa!! You saved me!!
Mikasa
Are you hurt anywhere?
Sasha
I’m safe, thanks to you!
Mikasa
Then stand! Now!
Connie
Sorry…
Annie
Never mind.
Reiner
Geez. That was too close, Annie.

I’m glad you weren’t injured.
[Action: Annie walks off.]
Jean
We got them all!

Everyone, stock up on supplies!
Armin
We did it!
Marco
Haah…
[Action: Marco nearly collapses in the lift. Armin and another soldier help him stand. The soldiers begin refilling their gas canisters.]
Soldiers
We’re safe now!

No more Titans are coming in!

That Aberrant berserker’s keeping them at bay!
Sasha
I surrendered to a Titan…

How can I look everyone in the eyes now?!
Connie
I’ll spank you for that later! Let’s just get out of here quick!
Jean
I don’t think I’m cut out to be a commander.

So don’t say that anymore.
Marco
There’s something I’d like to tell you. Don’t get mad, please.

You’re not strong, Jean. That’s why you can understand how the weak feel.

And you’re good at judging the situation correctly.

You always clearly know what you’re supposed to do, don’t you?
Jean
Ah…
Marco
Your orders were right.

That’s why I could run. That’s why I’m alive.
Jean
Ah…!
Soldiers
Are you all ready?

Let’s get outta here!

We’ve gotta bail now!

Go up the walls!

We need to meet up with the main units!
[Action: The soldiers exit the building and begin making their way toward the walls. Armin exits the building and sees Mikasa standing on the roof of a building.]
Armin
Ah… Mikasa?
[Action: Armin flies up toward Mikasa.]
Armin
Mikasa, we’ve gotta hurry!
Mikasa
That Titan…
Armin
Huh? Wha--?!
[Action: Armin looks in the same direction as Mikasa. He sees a group of Titans eating the Attack Titan.]
Armin
They’re eating it…
Attack.Titan
Uooooh…
Armin
Its body can’t regenerate?
Mikasa
I thought uncovering the truth about that Titan might be the key to freeing ourselves from this desperate situation.
[Action: Reiner, Bertolt, Annie, and Jean join Mikasa and Armin on the roof.]
Reiner
I agree.
Mikasa
Ah…
Reiner
If they just rip it to shreds like that, then we won’t have learned a single thing!

We should get rid of those Titans currently devouring it and at least try to keep it alive.
Jean
Are you insane, Reiner?!

We can finally escape this deathtrap!
Annie
But what if that Titan could become an ally?

Don’t you think it’d be a weapon more powerful than any cannon?
Jean
Our… ally? Are you for real?
Armin
Ah!
[Action: Armin turns to see another Titan approaching.]
Armin
That’s… the Aberrant that ate Thomas!
Attack.Titan
Uaaaaaah!!
[Action: With the last of its power, the Attack Titan pushes forward. Its arms are ripped off by the Titans trying to eat it, but it lunges toward the Aberrant and bites its neck. The Attack Titan lifts the Aberrant off the ground and throws it into one of the Titans nearby, smashing both into a building.]
Jean
H-Hey…
Attack.Titan
Uoooooh!!
Jean
What was that about helping it?
[Action: The Attack Titan collapses to the ground.]
Armin
Ahh!
Jean
Looks like it burnt itself out.

Whatever. Let’s get going!

There’s no way that monster’s on our side! Titans are Titans.
[Action: Mikasa and Armin stare at the Attack Titan down below. Jean notices nobody moving and turns to look back.]
Jean
What is it?
[Action: Out from the nape of the neck of the Attack Titan, a body appears. It pulls away from the Attack Titan’s corpse, revealing Eren.]
Mikasa
Ah… Ahh… Ah…!
[Action: Mikasa repels down to Eren.]
Armin
Mikasa!
[Action: Mikasa lands and runs to Eren’s body. She hugs him and listens for his heartbeat. When she hears it, she cries. Armin and the other soldiers descend alongside her. Before long, they all gather again on the top of a building. Mikasa is still holding Eren and crying.]
Armin
(Thoughts) It’s Eren…

(Thoughts) He’s even got his limbs back…

(Thoughts) Eren was eaten by that Titan back then.
[Action: Armin begins crying as well. He takes Armin’s left arm and clasps his hand.]
Armin
What just happened here?
Jean
Then Eren… did all of this?


Armin
(Narration) Over a century ago, mankind had to face a new enemy.

(Narration) The difference of power between mankind and their newfound foe was overwhelming. Soon, mankind was driven to the brink of extinction.

(Narration) The surviving humans built three walls: Maria, Rose, and Shina. Under their protection, they lived out the next century in peace.

(Narration) However…










Armin
(Narration) One of the reasons why the Titans’ attack on Trost claimed so many soldiers’ lives was that the elite Recon Corps wasn’t present.

(Narration) They’d left on a mission outside the Wall that very morning.
[Scene: The morning of the attack on Trost. Townsfolk and soldiers are gathered near the gates to see off the Recon Corps.]
Man 1
They’re here! It’s the main force of the Recon Corps!
Man 2
Commander Erwin! Kick their Titan asses for me!
Man 3
Look! It’s Lance Corporal Levi!

They say in battle, he’s as strong as a whole brigade!
Levi
Tsk… Shut up already…
Hanji
I bet they wouldn’t worship you so much if they knew what an obsessive clean freak you are!
Levi
Hmph.
[Action: The gates to the outside world open.]
Hanji
The Titans are out there!

I wonder what kind of Titans I’ll see this time!

I’d really love to see some abnormal ones!
Levi
I can see an abnormal one already.
Hanji
Huh? Where?
[Action: Levi grabs Hanji by the hair and turns her toward him.]
Levi
Right here.
Erwin
Move out!




Armin
(Narration) An extramural skirmish to secure a foothold for advancement.

(Narration) The Recon Corps entrusted with this mission were mankind’s best and brightest soldiers.

(Narration) The ingenuity of these few raised the survival rates for all. Even so, when troops advanced into Titan territory, casualties still exceeded 30%.

(Narration) That’s just how great the power gap between Titans and men was.


[Scene: In Trost. A soldier is getting eaten by a Titan.]
Soldier
Just… Just watch… you bastards…

Mankind will… destroy you all…

Mankind will… survive…
[Action: The soldier takes his blade and stabs the Titan in the face. The Titan bites down, severing the soldier’s body.]
Soldier
Uraah!!

You bastards… will all… fall to Lance Corporal Levi!
[Action: A 3DMG hook flies past the back of the neck of the Titan and into a wall. Levi flies past and slices into the neck of the Titan, killing it. Levi lands on the rooftop of a nearby building.]
Levi
(Thoughts) One on the right… Two on the left.
Petra
Lance Corporal, I’ve gathered the reinforcements!
Levi
Petra, look after that soldier down there.

The rest of you attack the one to the right.

I’ll clean up on the left.
[Action: Levi leaves to handle the Titans.]
Petra
What? Lance Corporal!
[Action: On the ground, two soldiers dodge out of the way of an attacking Titan.]
Soldiers
Woah!
[Action: Hanji flies through the air nearby.]
Hanji
Woohoo!!
[Action: Hanji lands on a nearby rooftop and turns to face the Titan as it turns toward her.]
Hanji
Don’t worry! I’m not gonna hurt you!
[Action: The Titan moves to grab Hanji as she leaps out of the way.]
Hanji
Woo!

Hahaha, not quite!

It’s my turn!

Gotcha!
[Action: Hanji slices the nape of the neck of the Titan.]
Hanji
See? It didn’t hurt, did it?
[Action: Levi makes his way over to the two Titans. He walks along the rooftop of a building.]
Levi
What a lovely bunch.

You all have such interesting faces.
[Action: Levi gracefully maneuvers in the air and topples one of the Titans.]
Levi
Urk!
[Action: As he moves toward the other Titan, he throws his blades into its eyes. Levi lands on the Titan’s head.]
Levi
Oof.

Stay still. Otherwise, I’ll never get a clean cut of your flesh.

Urk!
[Action: Levi topples the other Titan. He lands on the rooftop of a building and finds his hand covered with blood.]
Levi
Tsk. It got all filthy.
[Action: Levi makes his way down to the street, where Petra is trying to stop the bleeding of the soldier from earlier.]
Petra
Lance Corporal, I can’t stop the bleeding!
Soldier
Lance Corporal…
[Action: Levi kneels down by the soldier.]
Levi
What?
Soldier
Was I… useful to… mankind?

Or will I die… useless like this?
[Action: As the soldier raises his bloodied arm, Levi grabs his hand.]
Levi
You did great.

And you’ll do even more.

Your spirit will stay with me and give me strength!

I swear to you, I will exterminate the Titans!
Petra
Lance Corporal, he’s gone…
Levi
Did he hear everything?
Petra
I’m sure he heard it all.

He's resting so peacefully now.
Levi
Good, then…
Erwin
Levi!

We’re going back!
Petra
What?
Levi
Back?

We haven’t reached our limit yet.

Did my men die in vain?
Erwin
The Titans have all started heading north towards the city.
Petra
What?
Levi
Urgh…
Erwin
It’s just like five years ago.

Something’s happened in the city.

They might have even broken through the Wall.


[Scene: Flashbacks of the battle for Trost. Eren sees Armin reach out for him as the Titan swallows Eren.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Dammit… Dammit!
[Action: Eren wakes up to find himself in the stomach of a Titan, surrounded by dead soldiers.]
Eren
Ah! Ahh!!

(Thoughts) No… This can’t be…

(Thoughts) We’ve changed in five years… We trained to become soldiers… We thought we were soldiers…

(Thoughts) So that we could defeat them… So that they couldn’t prey on us…
Soldier
It’s hot…
Eren
Huh…?
[Action: Eren turns to find another soldier floating in the Titan’s stomach.]
Soldier
It’s so hot…

Help me… Mom… Mom!
Eren
(Thoughts) Mom… Mom…
Soldier
Help…
[Action: The soldier sinks into the stomach liquid.]
Eren
(Thoughts) Why must this happen? Why do they prey on us?

(Thoughts) They take our lives… our dreams…

Why?!

Dammit! God dammit!

I can’t give up just yet!

I’ll annihilate you! Every single one of you!

I’ll destroy you with my own hands!
[Action: From the mouth of the Titan, an arm comes shooting out. The Titan is killed, and from the back comes Eren in his Attack Titan form.]
Attack.Titan
Uraaahh!!
[Action: Another Titan approaches Eren’s Attack Titan. Eren’s Attack Titan crushes the first Titan’s neck and approaches the second Titan.]
Eren
(Thoughts) I’ll exterminate you all…

(Thoughts) I’ll purge this world…
Titan
Uahhh!!
[Action: The second Titan jumps toward Eren’s Attack Titan. Eren’s Attack Titan punches the Titan in the mouth, instantly killing it.]
Eren
(Thoughts) … of every last one of you!

(Thoughts) More! More!

(Thoughts) I’ll kill more of you! I wanna kill more!

(Thoughts) More… Kill them all!
[Scene: In the present day. Eren is in a daze while Armin supports him on his shoulder.]
Eren
I’ll kill you…
Armin
Eren?
[Action: Eren slowly returns to reality. He realizes that he, Armin, and Mikasa are surrounded by other troops and backed into a corner.]
Eren
Ah!
Mikasa
Eren!
Armin
Eren, can you move? Are you yourself again?

Tell them everything you know!

I’m sure they’ll understand!
Eren
Armin…
Soldier 1
Did you hear that? He said “I’ll kill you”!
Soldier 2
Yeah, I heard it, too. He wants to devour us all!
Eren
(Thoughts) What are you saying?

(Thoughts) Why are they raising their swords against us?

(Thoughts) Those are weapons for killing Titans!

(Thoughts) Why are they glowering at me like that?

(Thoughts) What’s going on?








[Scene: Inside Wall Rose. The cadets are gathered around to restock their supplies. Connie, Krista, and Ymir sit together.]
Soldier 1
All cadets are to ready their equipment and stand by!
Connie
So that’s how we managed to refill our gas and get out of Trost.
Krista
I’m so sorry…

We asked to send reinforcements for you.
Ymir
We even managed to secure some gas.
Krista
Wait, then the people who aren’t here are all…
Connie
Yeah…
Krista
Ah…
Ymir
Even Mikasa?
Connie
No… I thought Mikasa came back late with Jean and the others…
Ymir
Jean! Don’t tell me Mikasa was wounded?
Connie
Hey, what’s wrong?
[Action: Jean takes a drink of water but looks at the others sternly.]
Jean
We were sworn to keep it secret.
Connie
Secret?
Ymir
What the hell?
Jean
It’s hardly something they can keep covered up, though.

Soon, all of mankind will know about it.

If mankind survives long enough, that is.
[Scene: On Wall Rose. The Garrison troops stand on the wall, looking down at the Titans below.]
Hannes
They built a wall of flesh out of Titans.

The technical crew is pretty damn clever.

Still, we can’t afford to let our guard down.

This is the front line between mankind and Titans. We’re on the edge of a cliff.

What’s wrong?
Soldier 2
Nothing… Our mission is going smoothly.

I’m just worried about my comrades in the vanguard.

A messenger just rushed into HQ looking as pale as death.
Hannes
Yeah, but we need to stay focused on interception, just as we trained.
Soldier 2
I heard those three kids you rescued five years ago are cadets now.

Are they in the vanguard, too?
Hannes
Yeah…
Soldier 2
I’m sorry, sir. I’m talking too much.
Hannes
They’re fine.
Soldier 2
Ah…
Hannes
They’re strong. They each have a means of survival.

One is a skilled fighter. One has a tenacious spirit. And one is smart as a whip.

They’re fine. I know they’re alive.
[Scene: Back within the walls, where Eren, Armin, and Mikasa are being questioned.]
Kitz
Cadets Yeager, Ackermann, and Arlert!

Your present behavior is high treason!

What do you have to say in your defence?
Eren
What…?
Kitz
If you try anything deceitful or attempt to make a move, the artillery will open fire on you immediately!

We won’t hesitate!
Eren
Huh?
Kitz
I ask of you: What are you? A human or a Titan?
Eren
(Thoughts) What’s with that question?

(Thoughts) It’s like they’re all… staring at a monster.

(Thoughts) Is that what they think I am?

I… I don’t understand the question!
Kitz
You’re feigning ignorance?

Damn monster! Try playing dumb with me again!

We’ll blow you to bits in an instant! We won’t give you time to show your true face!
Eren
My true face?
Kitz
Everybody saw it!

You emerged from the carcass of a Titan!

Mankind has allowed creatures like you to infiltrate Wall Rose!

Even though you’re cadets sworn to the King himself, it’s appropriate to preemptively eliminate this risk!

I’m not wrong!

The Armored Titan that broke through Wall Maria could appear at any moment!

Mankind is once again on the brink of extinction!

Do you get it? We can’t afford to waste our troops and time on you!

I’ll blow you to pieces with the artillery!
Rico
They are clearly defiant.

I doubt we’ll be able to obtain any useful intelligence from them.

As you say, this is a waste of troops and time.
Soldier 3
Commander, it’ll be easy right now!

We can blow him away while he’s in human form!
Mikasa
My specialty is slicing up flesh.

If need be, I’m prepared to display it.

Anyone interested in experiencing my skills firsthand, step right up.
Kitz
Urk…
Ian
Commander, that’s Mikasa Ackermann. She was with our elite unit near the rear guard.

She’s worth a hundred average soldiers.

Losing her would be a huge blow to mankind.
Eren
Hey… Mikasa! Armin!

What’s going on?
Armin
Mikasa! You can’t fight our own people!

Where could we run within these crowded walls?
Mikasa
I don’t care who my opponent is. I’m not letting anyone kill Eren.

I couldn’t care less about anything else.
Armin
We need to talk with them!

No one knows what’s going on! Their fears are just running rampant!
Eren
(Thoughts) So I’m the only one who doesn’t think I’m a Titan?

(Thoughts) Dammit! I’ve got no memory at all of how I got here!

(Thoughts) I’m so worn out that I can’t stand. They’ll kill me if I say one thing wrong.

(Thoughts) Getting killed by humans… That’s just absurd!

(Thoughts) What’s this all about? I emerged from a Titan’s body?

(Thoughts) What’s he saying? What does that even mean?

(Thoughts) Wasn’t that just a dream?

(Thoughts) If not, that means everything below the sleeve on my arm grew back! That’s just like a Titan!

(Thoughts) It’s not possible. How’d I… How?!
Kitz
I’ll ask you once again! What are you?
Eren
(Thoughts) I can’t say anything wrong. It’s not just my life at stake.

(Thoughts) That’s right. All along, I’ve been just like you.

I’m human!
Kitz
I see.

Don’t think badly of me.
[Action: Kitz begins to raise his arm.]
Rico, Ian
Ah…
Armin
Ah!
Kitz
We’ve got no choice.

No man can prove… that he’s not a devil.
[Action: Kitz fully raises his arm, prompting the rest of the troops to read the cannons. Mikasa runs back toward Eren and Armin.]
Mikasa
Eren! Armin! We’re going up!
Eren
Wait!
[Action: Mikasa picks up Eren.]
Eren
Ugh!
[Action: As Mikasa runs away with Eren, Eren remembers the key around his neck.]
Grisha
(Flashback) Eren. When I return, I’ll show you the basement I’ve kept secret.
Eren
Urk!
Grisha
(Flashback) Always keep this key with you. Never let go of it.

(Flashback) And when you look at it, remember!

(Flashback) You must go to the basement!
Eren
Urgh!
Grisha
(Flashback) Because of these injections, your memories will be damaged.

(Flashback) So it’s pointless for me to explain things now.

(Flashback) Just remember this. Retake Wall Maria and reach that basement!

(Flashback) This power will prove useful then!

(Flashback) Their memories will show you how to use it!

(Flashback) Eren!
Eren
Ah!
[Action: Eren breaks free from Mikasa’s grip.]
Grisha
(Flashback) Once you enter the basement, you’ll find the truth!

(Flashback) It will be a hard and merciless road, but you must walk it!
[Action: A cannon fires.]
Grisha
(Flashback) If you want to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else, you’ve got to take control of this power!
[Action: Eren brings Mikasa and Armin close to him and bites his hand hard enough to draw blood. An explosion occurs, and a Titan’s arm is formed quickly enough to block the cannonball. An explosion can be heard throughout the area.]
Hannes
Ah!
Jean
A-Ahh…
Kitz
Did we get them?
Rico
Ugh…!
Kitz
No way…
[Action: The smoke clears, revealing the upper body of a partially-formed Titan surrounding Mikasa and Armin.]


Armin
(Narration) Year 845. The Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan appeared out of nowhere. Instantly, the walls were shattered, along with the illusory peace of everyday life.

(Narration) Mankind abandoned Wall Maria. They lost a fifth of their population and a third of their territory as human activity was pushed back to Wall Rose.

(Narration) Then, in Year 850, in Trost, mankind permitted the Titans to encroach further yet.

(Narration) Eren Yeager, despite having been eaten by a Titan, suddenly reemerged from a mysterious Titan’s corpse.








[Scene: Within the walls. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are surrounded and backed against a wall.]
Kitz
I’ll ask you once again! What are you?!
Eren
I’m human!
Kitz
I see… Don’t think badly of me.
[Action: Kitz raises his arm to signal the cannons to shoot.]
Eren
Ah!


[Scene: Within the walls. The young soldiers are gathered. Daz is having an existential crisis.]
Daz
Marco…

No… I can’t fight the Titans anymore!
Marco
What’s gotten into you?
Daz
My comrades were devoured right in front of me!

They got eaten, yet I felt neither hate nor sadness!

I was just thankful that it wasn’t me!

But I’ll be next.

I get it now. Our job is to fight until the Titans eat us!

If I’m just gonna get torn apart anyway, I’d rather --
[Action: Daz pulls out one of his blades. Marco stops him from doing anything to himself.]
Marco
Stop! Get a grip, man!

It’s not just you! Everyone is struggling with fear!

Look at Sasha! Even after all she’s been through, she’s still steady.
Sasha
Ahhhh!!

My stomach is killing me. May I go to the infirmary?
Daz
I can’t take this!
Marco
Stop it!
Jean
Good thing we were sworn to secrecy.

Everything’s already enough of a mess as it is.

If they found out about Eren…
[Action: An explosion can be heard coming from a distance.]
Jean
Woah!
Reiner
Cannon fire?
Jean
But why just one shot?
Soldiers
Look, smoke!

It’s inside the wall!

What’s that?

What’s going on?

Was the gate broken?

That’s the most fortified place! It can’t be!

Someone probably just dropped a cannonball.

But then what’s all that smoke?
Jean
Could it be steam from a Titan?
[Action: Reiner uses his 3DMG to hook onto a building and fly up.]
Jean
H-Hey!
[Action: Annie and Bertholdt follow Reiner.]
Jean
Hey!
[Action: Jean follows behind Reiner, Annie, and Bertholdt as they race toward the explosion.]


[Scene: Behind the wall where Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are cornered. Armin and Mikasa sit under the partially-formed Titan skeleton. Kitz, Rico, and the other soldiers stare in disbelief at the half-formed Titan. Jean, Reiner, Annie, and Bertholdt are standing on the roof of a building.]
Reiner
What’s going on down there?
Armin
Ah…
[Action: The bones of the half-formed Titan begin to crumble. The skull begins to move.]
Soldier
It’s alive!
Rico
Commanding Officer Woermann!
[Action: As the smoke clears, the eyeball of the Titan turns toward Kitz.]
Kitz
Eek! Look at that!

Stay back! It’s too dangerous!

Stand by on alert! Stand by!

Load the next round into the cannon!
[Action: Within the Titan, Eren tries to wake up. He opens his eyes to find that he’s stuck in the muscle of the Titan.]
Eren
Ah!

Urgh… Ahh!

Grr… Urgh!
[Action: Eren struggles but is able to free himself from the Titan’s neck.]
Eren
What the hell is this?
Armin
I remember hearing the cannon.

There was an awful noise, then that impact, and this heat.

Now we’re inside a gigantic skelet --
Mikasa
Eren protected us.

That’s all we need to know for now.
Armin
Inside here, even flowers were spared?
Eren
Hey!
Armin
Ah!
[Action: Eren runs around the side of the skeleton.]
Eren
Are you guys okay?
Armin
Eren, what is this?
Eren
I don’t know. But it’s evaporating.

It’s just like a Titan’s carcass. We should get away!

They’re still just watching, waiting to see what happens next.

The Garrison can’t see our movements right now.

But eventually, they will attack again.

After showing them that, I doubt we can talk our way out of this one.

I did remember one thing, though.

The basement. The basement of my old house.

My father said I would understand everything if I went there.

He’s also the reason I’m like this.

If I get to that basement, I’ll probably find out the truth about Titans, too.

Dammit!
[Action: Eren punches the Titan’s bone so hard that it fractures.]
Eren
Why did he keep it a secret?

It’s the intel the Recon Corps has been searching for at the cost of thousands of lives!

This is mankind’s last hope!

He was just keeping it locked away in the basement?

What the hell was he thinking?!

Where has he been these past five years, after he abandons us --
Mikasa
Eren. We’ve got more pressing concerns right now.
Eren
Yeah.
[Action: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin move from the area.]
Soldiers
The smoke is lifting!

We’ll attack once we can see them!

Let’s get this over with!
Kitz
Don’t move yet!
[Action: The skeleton continues to crumble. The skull falls to the ground and shatters, spreading more smoke into the area.]
Soldiers
Ahhh!
Eren
I’m… going to go away.
Mikasa, Armin
Huh?
Armin
Where to? How?
Eren
For now, anywhere will do.

Then I have to get over the wall and find my old basement.

Before that, I’ll need to become a Titan again.
Armin
You can do that?
Eren
I don’t know how myself.

But I think I can.

Just like you can’t explain how you make your arms move.

Earlier, I just focused on blocking the cannon fire.

That’s why my body had no real functionality or durability.

This time, I’ll try something stronger.

The 15-meter class form I used to kick the shit out of all those Titans!
Mikasa
Eren, your nose is bleeding.
Armin
Ah…
[Action: Eren wipes away the blood from his nose, confused.]
Armin
You’re really pale. Your breathing is heavy too.

Doing that clearly puts too much strain on your body!
Eren
I don’t care if I’m in bad shape right now.

I’ve got two ideas.

If you two don’t try to cover for me, they won’t kill you.

I’ve caused you enough trouble already.

From here on out, I’m doing this alone.
Armin
What? No! I --
Mikasa
Eren.

I’m coming too.
Eren
No.
Mikasa
If I can’t keep up with you, then don’t concern yourself with me.

But I don’t have to do whatever you say either.
Eren
Cut the crap already, for fuck’s sake!

I’m not your little brother or your kid!








[Scene: In the area where Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are cornered.]
Rico
Commanding Officer, the next round is almost finished being loaded. What’s the plan of attack?
Kitz
Wait for my signal!
Rico
Yes, sir.
Armin
(Thoughts) It doesn’t seem like the Garrison plans to initiate close combat just yet.

(Thoughts) Mikasa’s senses are sharper than a stray cat’s, so I’m sure she would have noticed any movements.

(Thoughts) Even if they load the next round as quickly as possible, it will still take at least twenty more seconds.

(Thoughts) Eren wants to act and leave before then.
[Action: Armin remembers back to when Eren and Mikasa protected him from bullies.]
Armin
Ah…

(Thoughts) Why am I remembering that now?

(Thoughts) Is it because this is the end for us?

(Thoughts) I guess that even in my final moments, I’m still nothing more than a coward.

(Thoughts) They’ve helped me out so many times, yet not once was I able to repay them.

(Thoughts) How could I consider myself an equal to such friends?

(Thoughts) How could I say, “I’m coming, too”?

(Thoughts) I’m not even sure if I could keep up with them.

(Thoughts) After this… the three of us will never be together again.
Mikasa
Eren, I --
Eren
Wait, Mikasa.

I said I had two ideas.

Armin, I want you to make the final call.
Armin
Ah… Huh?
Eren
I’m fully aware of how unrealistic this plan is.

Even so, our best option would be using this Titan power strategically to aid the army.

I know it sounds insane, but if you’re confident that you can convince the Garrison that I’m not a threat, then I’ll believe in you and stay here.

That’s my second idea.

If you say you can’t do it, then I’ll go with my last resort, the option I described earlier.
[Action: The soldiers begin aiming the cannons.]
Eren
You’ve got fifteen seconds to decide.

Can you do it or not? Either way, I’ll respect your opinion.
Armin
Eren… why would you entrust such an important decision to me?
Eren
No matter how messed up things get, you always figure out the best solution.

I want to rely on you.
Armin
Huh? When have I ever…
Eren
A bunch of times.

Five years ago, if you hadn’t gotten Hannes, Mikasa and I would have been eaten by that Titan.
Armin
Ah…
[Action: The Titan skeleton continues to deteriorate. The spine falls behind Armin.]
Armin
(Thoughts) It was all in my head…

(Thoughts) I had just convinced myself that I was a useless burden…

(Thoughts) They didn’t think of me that way at all!
Eren
Armin, we’re running out of time.
Rico
The cannon is loaded.

We can fire at any time.
Armin
(Thoughts) The two people I trust more than anyone in the world want to entrust their lives to me.

(Thoughts) What more evidence could I possibly need?
[Action: Armin stands.]
Eren, Mikasa
Ah…
Armin
I’ll convince them.

Do your best to show them that you don’t intend to resist.
Mikasa
Okay.
Eren
Yeah.
[Action: Armin walks forward toward Kitz.]
Armin
(Thoughts) Something’s been troubling me ever since I saw Eren fight as a Titan.

(Thoughts) I haven’t even sorted out my own thoughts yet, but I’ve got to do this.

(Thoughts) I’ll have to think while I speak!
[Action: Armin releases the 3DMG from his waist. The fall to the ground noisily.]
Soldiers
Woah!
[Action: Armin runs through the smoke and out into the open.]
Kitz
Wah! Stop!
[Action: A soldier aims a gun at Armin as he skids to a stop and raises his arms.]
Kitz
You finally showed your true colors, monster.

I’ll signal! I’ll signal the cannon!
Armin
He isn’t the enemy of mankind!

We’re willing to share all the intelligence we’ve gathered!
Kitz
Begging for your lives is useless now!

He revealed his true form right in front of us! There is nothing left to say!

If you say he’s not an enemy, then prove it!

If you can’t do that, I will eliminate the threat!
Armin
There’s no need for further proof!

(Thoughts) That’s right. It’s unnecessary!

The issue isn’t how we see him!
Kitz
What?
Armin
You said everybody saw him!

Then they must have seen him fighting the Titans, too!

And they must have seen all the Titans ganging up against him!

The Titans see him as prey, just like the rest of mankind!

Nothing you say can change that fact!
Soldiers
That’s true…

A Titan as an ally?

That can’t be…
[Action: The soldiers begin to lower their weapons.]
Kitz
Guh… Urgh…

Krr… Prepare to attack!

Don’t fall for this clever trap!
Armin
Ah!
Kitz
Their actions have always been beyond our comprehension!

If they can transform into humans and speak our language, that’s just another way for them to fool us!

We can’t let them do as they please!
[Action: The soldiers ready their weapons again.]
Armin
(Thoughts) It’s no use… He’s stopped thinking entirely…

(Thoughts) He’s too scared to think…

(Thoughts) Eren! Mikasa!
[Action: Armin turns back to look at Eren and Mikasa. Their faces are calm. Eren nods at Armin. Armin faces forward with new determination and salutes with his fist over his heart.]
Armin
As a soldier, I swore to devote my heart to the resurrection of mankind!

There is no greater glory than dying for that belief!

If we added his Titan power to the might of our armies, it might even be possible to recapture the town!

For the glory of the human race, I beg you in my final moments before I die, permit me to explain his strategic importance!
Ian
Commanding Officer, we should consider wh --
Kitz
Silence!

(Thoughts) No matter how they plead for their lives, they’re still rebels!
[Action: Kitz begins to raise his arm, much to Armin’s horror.]
Kitz
(Thoughts) Those who break the rules must be eliminated!

(Thoughts) That’s what it means to be a soldier!
[Action: Mikasa prepares to draw her blades. Eren prepares to bite his thumb. As Kitz brings his arm down, he is stopped by Pixis.]
Pixis
Cut it out already.

You haven’t changed. As big as you are, you’ve still got the guts of a scared fawn.
Kitz
Commander Pixis?
Pixis
Can’t you see how magnificent his salute is?

I just arrived, but the situation has already been relayed to me.

You go organize the reinforcements.

I think it’ll be worthwhile to hear what they’ve got to say.
[Action: Armin falls to his knees.]


Armin
(Narration) Based on the Recon Corps reports, the Titans were predicted to come from the south.

(Narration) They originally hit Shiganshina first, in the southern district of Wall Maria.

(Narration) Therefore, it was suspected that their next target would be Trost, the southernmost fortified city along Wall Rose.

(Narration) Dot Pixis. The Commander-in-Chief of the defense of the southern territories, including Trost. A man entrusted with complete authority over the key area of mankind’s defenses.
[Scene: On the Trost inner wall. Pixis looks over the edge at a gathering of Titans below. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin stand to the side.]
Pixis
Still haven’t seen one…

I wouldn’t mind being eaten, as long as it was by a scorchingly hot lady Titan.
Armin
(Narration) He’s also known as an inveterate eccentric.
Kitz
What is the Commander thinking?

How could he take such dangerous elements up there without any guards?!
Rico
The Commander’s reasoning is beyond the comprehension of mere men.
Ian
Commanding Officer, the troops are information.
Kitz
Good job.
Pixis
I see. So you believe that the basement holds all the answers you seek?
Eren
Yes. Will you believe me, sir?
Pixis
Since even you yourself can’t say for sure, let’s just say I’ll keep it in mind for now.

However, you can prove your true intentions by your actions right now.

I’ll guarantee your safety myself.
Armin, Eren
Ahh…
Pixis
Cadet Arlert, was it?
Armin
Yes, sir!
Pixis
Earlier, you said that by using this “Titan power”, we might be able to retake this city.

Do you really believe that, or were you just desperate to stay alive?
Armin
It was… both, sir.

I was trying to say that Eren could take on his Titan form, carry that boulder to the wall, and block the gap in the gate.

The thought just occurred to me…

But couldn’t you look at Eren’s power as a change to turn this situation to our favor?
Pixis
Hmm…
Armin
Of course, I was also desperate to save our lives…
Pixis
“Desperate to save”…

Those words are worth more than anything.
[Action: Pixis takes a swig of drink from his flask.]
Pixis
What do you say, Cadet Yeager?
Eren
Sir?
Pixis
Can you close the gap?
Mikasa, Armin
Huh?
Eren
I… I…

I’m not sure. I don’t understand this any more than the rest of you.

It’d be irresponsible of me to answer as if I knew either way.
Pixis
Oh right, sorry. I asked the wrong question.
Eren
Ah…
Pixis
Will you do it or not? Which is it?
Eren
Ah…!
[Action: Pixis stares intently at Eren. As Pixis turns his gaze past Eren, Eren also turns to look out toward the vast expanse of their world.]
Eren
I’ll do it.

I will do it!

I’m not certain that I can close the gap, but I’ll still do it!
